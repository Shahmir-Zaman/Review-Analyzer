hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"i stayed here for a vacation, hoping to enjoy the location, but we received so much more. the room was so good. comfortable and clean, we really enjoyed relaxing on the sofa at the end of each day. beds were comfortable, linens were soft, and the kitchen was supplied with glassware and plates to enjoy dinner with our shoes off. amina at the front desk always greeted us with a smile and was helpful in answering all our questions. the shuttle made getting around town very easy, though when you are across the street from seattle center, you really don't need to use it much! the view from our room was the space needle, and i loved it. breakfast was surprisingly large and varied from day to day kudos to the breakfast staff for keeping the buffet area well stocked and clean. i hope to return, as i very much enjoyed my stay. try this when you go to seattle!dear wandap,thank you for taking the time to review our hotel on trip advisor! i am very glad to hear that you had a great stay and that you enjoyed our location across the street from the space needle! i will pass onto the staff that you enjoyed our free breakfast buffet and thought their service was deserves kudos! i hope the next time you are in town you choose us again! sincerely,jonathan","location, amenities, and great service!"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"to describe who is writing this, i was a single traveller with a 3-person party one floor down. my basic expectations are: clean-no trace of previous guests, good bed with bleach-white sheets. i don't really expect to be hosted, or served well, just not rudely. i didn't want to detract from my overall satisfaction with the accommodations, so i gave 5 stars. here are a couple of downsides: the desk person who checked us in was not fabulous. our party had split up for check-in, as there is nowhere for any parking besides the basement, and mcdonald's across the street, she decided to get tough with my mother, who had paid for the accommodations, and insist that the would not surrender all room keys until all parties were present. even though we are all responsible adults. so she had to walk across a downtown street, get me, and return to get a second room key, which was a bit wierd. when checking in, she asked if i needed a room with a view this sounded like an offer, so i asked if it would cost my mom less. no. the prices are all the same for that room type. do you need a room with a view at this point i'm a bit bothered and a bit offended, because she has avoided simply asking if she could give me an interior room as a favour to the hotel, which i would have gladly obliged, but it was starting to sound like special request - room with a view like i had requested a crib. she also gave us the usual pre-flight bathrooms down the hall blah-blah, never cracking a smile. she never mentioned that the elevators are super-confusing, with only one going down to the parade, so if you hit down from floor 7, you might get the lobby only car, might not, it's completely random. even if it seems no one else is using the elevators at all. the stairs will not take you past floor 1 so us skip the wait and run the stairs folks do not have that option. so after check-in, we accidentally boarded the top-to-lobby elevator, trying to get down to the parade, and had a super-confusing time learning all these facts as we went. so ask how the elevators work, please. i took the interior room, which faces windows to the hall and other rooms. in such a room, it would be easy to accidentally see or be seen by other guests. in the afternoon i was watching tv, and could easily see the cleaning lady in the room across, the windows are only perhaps 8 feet apart. so privacy screen down, blackout shades pretty much all the time. otherwise this property is gorgeous, has a charming rooftop courtyard with bbq and firepit, the fitness facility is ok, and the breakfast is included and hyatt standard which i love! you should know that you cannot get access to the parade in any way without a key, my mom lost the key while sorting out the rooms, and we got stuck with a car behind us while she had a panic attack. a phone attached to the card reader links you to the front desk.......eventually. very eventually.cclelland2016,we are thrilled to hear the hyatt house met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. im glad you were able to take advantage of the rooftop terrace, fitness center and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. we look forward to your next visit in seattle!sarah junge",fabulous hotel under the space needle
hyatt house seattle/downtown,3,"the room was nice and modern. parking is very limited and hard to get to. if you don't get parking in their small garage, then you have to pay for parking across the street. there is only a very small area to park your car to even check in and no valet is available. the reception desk seems cold and not very welcoming. the staff was anxious to help but i got the wrong parking pass 3 times. hotel is clean and across from the space needle. we had an awesome view of it. good luck",across from space needle but overpriced
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"this hotel was wonderful. the staff was excellent and even though we had a car, we never used it due to the location in the downtown area and the shuttle that took us to the other places we wanted to go. we would definitely stay here again and recommend it to our friends.robert s,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.sarah junge",restful time in seattle
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,my mom and i stayed for three nights in april. the hotels location cannot be beat. it is right across the street from the seattle space needle and the museum of pop culture. best part of our hotel stay was when we walked into our room. not only was it huge but the view was absolutely stellar with a view of the space needle.the staff at this hotel is without a doubt the most attentive and friendly staff i have ever seen at a hotel. everyone from the front desk staff to the morning breakfast staff (breakfast is complimentary by the way) was awesome.only minor issue we had was getting back to the hotel on the complimentary shuttle. we called and arranged a time to be picked up but the shuttle did not show up at the correct time. shuttle driver was very apologetic and friendly. this is a new service and as with every new service there are bound to be minor issues. this minor issue will not stop us from booking here again.thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts about our hotel. i am thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that our team was friendly and attentive. thank you as well for your patience and understanding with the shuttle and we hope to see you again on your next visit to seattle!,perfection. with just a minor inconvenience
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"room 428.10taxes and parking 99.04we are hyatt members, so we earn points, etc., when staying here or any hyatt related property. we booked online, which was easy and received reminders about our stay.the hotel is across the street from the space needle and grounds. we went to a concert at key area, which is about 4 blocks walking. lots to do just outside the hotel door.parking can be tricky, especially if you have more than 1 car per room, which is the allotment in the garage. it is a safe and secure garage.breakfast was good buffet style. drinks, happy hour, snacks were good 4 chicken quasedea slices, 3 pork sliders were good with 2 lemon drops and 2 espresso martini's 70.the room was comfortable with a great view of the space needle and grounds. big tv, slightly smallish bathroom if two people are trying to get ready at the same time and a big comfortable bed.no valet (park in front to register and get your parking pass to the garage) and no help to your room with the bags (get the cart in the lobby). people were however, friendly, helpful and quick to answer questions or be of assistance in some manner.dear akittynamedtabitha,thank you very much for reviewing our hotel! i am so happy to hear that you had fun in seattle and enjoyed our location! our room prices do fluctuate from day to day and are often much lower than the price you paid. we actually currently have a promotion going that give 10 off if you book directly with hyatt. i hope that you and your family enjoyed the concert. your stay with us is exactly when we try to accomplish. we very much appreciate your business and we hope we get a chance to host you again soon. warm regards,jonathan",one night stay before the concert
hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"we stayed at the hyatt house because it was convenient to the emp, as we were taking a vocal workshop. the room had greasy fingerprints all over the microwave, chairs around the bar were askew, and the shower was dirty with large spots of soap scum all over it. we called the front desk and they asked if they could clean it the next day! we said, no, we are checking out then and want to take a shower in the morning. they said they would send someone up. i pulled back the covers on the bed to make sure the sheets had been changed and there was a plastic wrapper and a dirty wash rag. needless to say, we went downstairs and said, please put us in another room. the next room was not very clean either, but better than the first one.kimbrleedo,feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns. we strive to exceed all of our guests expectations and know we still have some work to do. please know this is extremely important to me and i'm working with my executive housekeeper to correct any issues. please let us know if there is anything we further assist with - we look forward to another opportunity to serve you in the future.sarah junge",poor housekeeping
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"the room was very nice. it included a kitchenette and a seating area that is separated to the sleeping area by the tv stand, which made the room feel more homey. the included daily breakfast was great too, not only were there pastries but breakfast meats and made to order omelettes. i would definitely stay here again.",just a walk away from the needle
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"our stay at the hyatt house in seattle was a totally satisfying experience. the staff was professional, the facilities immaculate, the room fabulous and looked out on the space needle totally convenient to seattle centre and the free shuttle gave me access to the downtown core and pike place market.david w,thank you for staying with us next to the space needle! we love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. as one of the newest members to the hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. we pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.sarah junge",superb service
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"stayed on this hotel for a business trip, but it allowed the trip to become a sight-seeing one. the room faced the space needle and emp museum. the room was cozy, had all amenities (it was a house room with kitchenette, fridge, microwave). the place is very clean and modern, and the staff were very accommodating and understanding when there was a charge issue with my corporate card. the place has free shuttles to downtown seattle, and is within walking distance from a lot of tourist attractions. i would stay on this hotel again, no problem.dear ugo c,thank you for completing a tripadvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. i am glad to hear that you found our location to be great and our hotels staff to be helpful and accomodating! i greatly appreciate your 5 star review it will be celebrated with the hotel. if i can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. we very much appreciate your business! sincerely,jon",great hotel right across the street from the space needle
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"directly across space needle, chihuly and emp. loved the secured parking, worth the extra cost. would stay here again! everything was quick to access. the room itself was comfortable with a mini kitchen, and sitting area. having the tv rotate to either side of room was helpful. every staff member from front desk, maids, maintenancell were friendly and helpful. i felt safe and our stay was extremely comfortable. there is a mcdonald's across the street for those needing a quick bite, not a fan but it was nice to know it was there.only thing that could have oneimproved our stay was more time!",this is the one to stay at
hyatt house seattle/downtown,3,"i would not recommend this hotel, the staff were not helpful, we had issues with our bills and the front desk said they could not adjust. the power went out in the room and maintenance could not fix it, got ready in the dark with no power.",not impressed
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"the location next to the space needle, the vibrant colors in the interior, the complimentary breakfast, a full equipped kitchenette and above all the courteous staff- what could one ask for more. brilliant in all aspects.raj shankar g,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.sarah junge",brilliant in all aspects
hyatt house seattle/downtown,3,"i really enjoyed the room and vibe at the hyatt house in seattle. it was a great hotel to chill out and get work done. we were able to work all day during a rainstorm and the room was comfortable and large enough for 2 people to never cross paths while working.my only complaint is that they checked me out early before my guest was ready and they woke him up and interrupted him 9 times between the time i left and he checked out. upon calling the hotel, the staff was very apologetic and gave him a nice bottle of wine to compensate for the miscommunication.",great hotel but with some hiccups
hyatt house seattle/downtown,1,"the hotel is well located for tourist attractions and check-in was easy. getting maid service of any kind was next to impossible. no one would take responsibility of any kind. i called corporate and they agreed and called the hotel. finally a general manager spoke with me and guaranteed my room would be cleaned between 9 am and 2 pm the next day when i was to attend a wedding. it didn't happen. bathroom trash really does need to be disposed of daily. both elevators broke during our stay and we never saw a repair person. so 6 flights of stairs every time. what was to have been a joyous occasion turned in to a very bad experience.dear travelingjeffry,thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us here at the hyatt house seattle. i am sorry that your stay did not go as planned and that your room was not serviced and the elevators were down for maintenance. i can see how this would be create a very bad experience or you while you were in town for a wedding. also that i did not get to speak with you in person while you were staying with us. if you choose to stay with us again and i hope you do give us another opportunity then please reach out to me directly and i will ensure your stay is wonderful. again i am sorry if we let you down this is the opposite of our purpose. sincerely,jonathan",your room will never be cleaned
hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"we arrived quite early so weren't surprised that we couldn't check in. we were told the room was clean but hadn't been inspected yet. we took the shuttle to pike place market for a long lunch then put our 85-year-old mother in an uber to go back to the hotel. it still hadn't been inspected so she had to sit in the lobby till it was ready. we were thrilled with our view of emp, space needle and chihuly garden. we had a 1-bedroom suite which is just a regular room with a partial wall to separate the sofa bed from the queen beds. we slept 6 fairly comfortably. twice when we wanted to shuttle back to the hotel we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone. in the afternoon it took over an hour to finally get a shuttle and since it was a different driver he had a different pick-up place. we almost missed it but happened to look around the corner and half a block up then ran to catch it. after dinner when we again couldn't get through to the desk we called central reservations because they always answer the phone. they tried for 20 minutes to get through to our hotel and couldn't. they finally told us to take a taxi or an uber and we would be reimbursed. sure enough - standard practice. when we got back to the hotel the only person at the front desk told his sad story of being so tired and groggy because he had worked a graveyard shift the night before and was the only person at the desk for 2 hours. there was the shuttle driver sitting with nothing to do because if no one answers the phone and finds out where he needs to go he can't actually go anywhere. very frustrating! on the plus side - breakfast was very good. this place is way overpriced though (over 400 for one night) and not the standard one expects from a hyatt.dear jenh,thank you for taking the time to review the hyatt house seattle and thank you very much for the feedback. we will use your comments to improve our hotels operations. i am sorry that your room was not ready by the time you returned for your day out. also to hear your experience with our front desk and shuttle staff is disheartening. the issues you experience will be addressed. again i apologize that your stay did not go smoothly as it should have. i hope that you will give us another opportunity the next time you are in town and feel free to contact me directly so i can assist with your next stay personally. sincerely,jonathan","great view, comfortable room, grossly understaffed"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"this is the most well run and cleanest of the hyatt house (hyatt place/hyatt regency) hotels i have stayed in. the entire staff is extremely friendly helpful. the breakfast is fantastic. freshly made omeletes and delicious buffet choices every morning, while other hyatts also have the same breakfast, this location goes above and beyond with the quality care they put into the service. it makes having to work while in seattle, a pleasure.darcie e,it was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the hyatt house seattle downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting. i will share your feedback with all of the team who has been consistently recognized as exceeding customer service standards. we appreciate the positive comments and will look forward to your future visits to seattle.sarah junge",most friendly staff cleanest hyatt!
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"new year's eve fireworks on the rooftop patio were fantastic! but so was the room, service, location, free breakfast, and shuttle to downtown locations! easy access to kid friendly science and pop culture museum, pike market, sculpture gardens and underground tour. the only place i'd ever stay in seattle with family!",the best location for families and fireworks!

hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"when we booked the hotel we requested that we have a view of the space needle when i called the day before we left to confirm our stay the woman i spoke too specifically said she was going to be the one to assign the rooms would make sure we had a view we arrived and while we checked in the front desk man seemed bothered by us. we asked where we pull up for the bell hop to help us with our bags (we were in town for a book signing, so we had boxes of books, table decorations,gifts etc.) not to mention we were staying for a week so we had quite a few bags. we were told","close to everything, but customer service is not worth it."
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"dan at the desk was as usual very helpful, gary the van driver was fun. they took us to the conference center and when done picked us up.the view from the room is space needle. you pay a little more for the view but well worth it. easy 2 blocks to the needle and pacific center. good food within walking distance.johngraver,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. i will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. we are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. please let us know when you plan on returning to seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!sarah junge",another great stay.
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"i'm sure many people bill hyatt house downtown as a hip, penthouse style apt, where you can go out and see what makes seattle great, and it is. from my window on the 8th floor, you can overlook the space needle, museums below, giant artwork molds and the bustle of a city come alive with fun!for me though, it was all about winding down from a 13-week stint from my company, and meeting a friend, to start an adventure down the coast. i relished that i could bring up delicious sandwiches from the downstairs eatery, or go up on the rooftop and just hang out. i loved the view of the bay from my loft style suite, while reading a book. i liked curling up in their oh so comfy bed, with their plush pillows that were perfectly for resting and rejuvenating a weary soul.mostly, i loved the fact that i could just be. and i think that is the point of hyatt house. you make it what you want it. and its oh so easy to do that...dear sbtimetraveler,thank you very much for taking the time to write a review of our hotel and your stay here at the hyatt house seattle. we very much appreciate all the feedback we get. i am very happy to hear that you felt our hotels rooms were hip and what you were looking for, i am glad that you enjoyed the view of the space needle.these are the kind of reviews that we strive for. i hope the next time you are in the seattle area that you choose us again. we know you have a lot of choices. sincerely,jon",a place to wind down

hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"the location is great. it is across the street from the seattle center therefore the space needle, pacific science center, the armory, emp, museum of pop culture, artists playground, etc. are very easy to get to. the rooms are suites. it seems the ones facing the space needle (01-10) are more spacious or the layouts seems more spacious. i had family in a 19 room, which was a corner and it had the same features but a smaller table/island and living space. the suites are well supplied with everything you would need and the front desk is more than happy to give you extra supplies.the staff at this hotel is excellent. they are accommodating and very considerate. they call it a continental breakfast but i think it is significantly better than that. it has several hot food options, which change everyday and there is a always an omelet bar. in your room, there is a note with the rush hours for the free breakfast. it is pretty accurate. they also have a great happy hour and coffee is always available downstairs. for picky kids or late night eats or when the armory is already closed, there is a 24 hour drive thru mcdonalds.the only issue i had with the location was the parking garage. the spaces are tight. and you are assigned a space when you check in. the garage is underneath the hotel (which is convenient) but to drive in and out you have to use a special garage key. however, with the monorail across the street you probably do not need car.",perfect hotel for families and large groups
hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"not pleased. poor experience. will definitely stay somewhere else next time. 7 day/6 night stay...zero cleaning despite numerous requests, no fresh towels or linens entire week other than towels/soap/toilet paper we helped ourselves to from nearby cart. overflowing garbage cans were finally put in hallway day 4.dear robinsu9085vk,thank you very much for taking the time our of your day to review our hotel and share your stay with us. i very much appreciate the feedback and i am very sorry to hear about the poor costumer service you experienced. i assure you that your feedback is taken seriously and we will use it to better our hotels operations. i am happy to hear that you enjoyed our great location. please keep us in mind the next time you are in the seattle area. we would love to be given another opportunity to ensure you have a great stay. please feel free to reach out to me personally. we do appreciate your business. sincerely,jonathan",great location. poor customer service.

hyatt house seattle/downtown,1,"we had booked this hotel for two nights after our cruise in january . two months before we were to arrive our plane home was moved to an exceptionally early time. we decided we had to stay at an airport hotel in order to make our plane, since we had to be at the airport by 4:30am. i called to cancel the one night. imagine my surprise when hyatt raised the room rate for the remaining night 165. i questioned the reasoning and was told that even though we had until 24 hours before to cancel they treated the remaining night as a new reservation. we found a different hotel a block away and cancelled this entire reservation. beware!",angry cancelled stay

hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"while the hotel is clean and in an excellent location, you will not get a good night's sleep here if you have neighbors above you who need to fulfill their 10,000 daily steps in the middle of the night. of the four nights we stayed here all four nights were full of different neighbors above us who for some reason need to walk back and forth around their room all night long, banging cabinets, doors, etc. complaints to the house host were not helpful at all. we never got a decent night sleep here. also, don't believe the shuttle stuff. we tried every day to get one, first being told just call 10 mins before you need one, then told you must come downstairs in person and wait, and oh by the way it would be a 40 min wait (when the shuttle only goes a 1 mile radius i do not understand). never was able to get a shuttle the entire time we were there. the staff at the morning buffet were wonderful, friendly, but the hot food was not hot, the selection was small. and lastly, take the stairs. the elevator is s-l-o-w. we often waited more than 5 minutes. i would not stay here again, mostly because of the noise factor.hello, julie!thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. we are sorry to hear that you did not get a good nights sleep - that's the exact opposite of what we are shooting for! noise complaints are relatively uncommon for us, and we will investigate a bit to see if anything can be done about the particular room you stayed in. i am sorry too to hear of your experience with the shuttle. i know it seems crazy, but with traffic sometimes a shuttle run for several passengers within a mile can take much longer than expected. it sounds like we could have done a much better job communicating with you though. we appreciate the feedback and will certainly use it as a training opportunity internally. thank you again and we hope to have the chance to serve you again - with a good nights sleep!","be forewarned, ceilings are thin... you will hear neighbors"

hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"i visited with my husband and 16 yr old daughter and best friend and her family. we each got suites with a view before an alaska cruise. the rooms are clean, large and well decorated-exceeded all expectations. the breakfast is good. not fantastic but a nice way to start the day. the super bar is friendly and reasonable-we did not try the food. the location is excellent-seattle is such a good walking city (this was our first time)- its walking distance from most places and still in a pretty quiet spot. our room had a view of the space needle. what makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. the people were simply fantastic-truly customer focused and just plain kind. we had booked the rooms nine months in advance at a 40 discount from the current rate . we were meeting other friends (mom and two teens) that had booked air bnb. by 11 pm they still had not been able to reach their host and were threatening sleeping in their car. because we had a suite that sleeps six, i asked them to stay in our room. i went to the front desk to explain the situation, ask for bedding -credit card in hand. they were wonderful. they saw how desperate we were, chuckled and smiled and asked what kind of bedding we needed and waved away my card (hope i am not getting anyone in trouble). the bedding was there in 10 min. ive never experienced such warm hospitality and i am truly grateful. thanks for a memorable and wonderful visit!",what a delight
hyatt house seattle/downtown,3,"despite booking the room type that you think you are getting online, you may find out that the room looks nothing like what you see in the pictures and what is described. the hotel is newer, in a great location and parking is more affordable than most hotels. if the room type is something that you look for in booking a hotel, then my suggestion is go in with low expectations. hello!thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. while we have a number of different room configurations, all of the photographs on our website are taken here at the hotel and are of the specific room types they advertise. it sounds like we made a mistake with your reservation, which is definitely not typical. i am so sorry that was your experience and hope to have a chance to serve you again in the future. please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you are coming back to seattle. we would be happy to take the time to double-check that your preferences are being honored, as is our standard operating procedure. thank you again and safe travels to you, wherever you go!",rooms
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"we stayed in the hyatt house for one night just before xmas. easy to get to via the link and then one stop on the monorail, we had asked for an early check in, and our room was ready on arrival at noon. the room itself was stunning, immaculately clean (as was the rest of the hotel) and well appointed. location was sensational (50 yards from the space needle and glass museum) and a 7 uber down to pike st market. breakfast was fine and checkout easy we left having had an excellent stay.",excellent stay.
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"pros: excellent location. directly across from seattle ctr. space needle was directly outside of my window which was a nice view. the room is nice and spacious. breakfast is good. the stop is nice and efficient. there's truly no reason to rent a car staying at this location. most things are within walking distance all within about a mile. and the hotel offer shuttle service within 1 mile. cons: my room was located directly off of the elevator which was allowed in the middle the night when people were getting back again. my son and myself are woke up each night due to the noise. the room was in need of some minor repairs which in my opinion should've been taken care of prior to the room being rented out. things such as some touch up paint, a broken doorstop on the floor which my son picked up and tried to eat with the screw hanging out of the bottom of it, and a broken hand rail inside the shower on the door which was left hanging. breakfast on the weekend as far as the omelette station goes is extremely slow because there is only one person making omelettes. we were told it would take 25 minutes and after 40 we still had not received our omelettes, nor did we ever receive our omelettes that day. we rented a car because it was our first time here. if you have to rent a car the parking garage is rather strange and the spots are tight. your spot is assigned so forewarning, there are some spots such as 19, you guessed it, my spot! which is ridiculous. this spot not only has a huge pile which lands right at your door so you can't get out and if they place ppl in the spots slightly behind you then you can't get out even in a small car because these spots are caddy corner/ next to this spot making it impossible to get out of unless you have a motorcycle......... and for al this hassle you pay 25 per night!!!!! lastly, i did not like how there are only two elevators with this hotel which are rather small which wouldn't be a problem if it were only the guest using but. the employees try to get on them with the guest with their cleaning carts, dirty linens, food carts, etc. so if you are a guest with luggage, wheelchair, stroller, etc. it is a very tight squeeze on the elevator. and the employees are insistent on getting on with you instead of waiting for the next one. many times we were cramped in the elevator due to this.","overall, very good just a few minor glitches"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"from the minute i arrived it felt like i was staying at a friends, very warm and welcoming. great location and staff was friendly. told all my coworkers and recommended the hotel for them to stay in at their next visit to seattle!dear edwardo devinci,thank you for completing a tripadvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. i am glad to hear that you and your enjoyed the view and felt very warm and welcoming! this is our objective. we greatly appreciate your 5 star review it will be celebrated with the hotel. if i can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. we very much appreciate your business and hope to see you again soon! thank you for the recommend as well! sincerely,jon",hotel with a view
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"reasonably priced hotel with large rooms in downtown seattle. staff in reception were very helpful at all times. room - aparthotel style - cooker, dishwasher, fridge, microwave all available. bed was really comfy and the electric black out blinds were put to good use.food - breakfast was buffet style and good. there is an omelette bar but if you hit peak times you can be asked to wait 30 mins so plan around it. the restaurant is more bar food but had a reasonable selection and not too pricy. good selection of local craft beers and wines and if that is to your taste you will appreciate it.qfc - turn left exiting the hotel and three blocks away on mercer there is a large qfc where you can stock up on any possible groceries, toiletries, wines/beers you might need for your stay.location - pretty good overall about a 20 min walk and you are in the heart of downtown shopping macys, nordstrom, gap etc etci would stay here again without hesitation.",comfortable hotel- good location
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"this is really a prime location and i loved our view of the space needle from our room. rooms were very luxurious and comfortable. i ran a marathon on this stay and the hotel accommodated all the runners by providing breakfast earlier. breakfast was so yummy, and they have happy hour every day with half priced appetizers which are as big as meals. the only downside is the 25 charge for parking per daymichelle d,thank you for taking the time to submit such pleasant comments about us at the hyatt house seattle downtown. we are so ecstatic to hear you enjoyed our happy hour, morning breakfast spread, and unbeatable location next to the space needle. we look forward to hosting you in the future until then, happy travels!sarah junge",loved the room
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"great hotel, in a perfect location, right across from the space needle and museum of pop culture. included breakfast is fantastic, lots of variety and super friendly staff. studio room was spacious (2 queen beds and a sofa bed), kitchen and bathroom were nice sized and modern. there is underground parking, for about 30. it's about a 20-minute walk to pike place market.great hotel, i'd stay there again whenever in seattle.",awesome hotel. nice rooftop. great view. perfect location.
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"you can't get any closer to the space needle in terms of accommodation it's right across the street! fantastic view of the space needle from the hotel's rooftop deck, especially at night. front desk staff were very friendly and eager to please. free hotel shuttle anywhere within one mile of the hotel was helpful for getting to and from the waterfront and pike place market. hotel decor was too cold and masculine for what i would expect from a hyatt. only two elevators made for a long wait to get down to the lobby in the mornings. breakfast in the lobby bar was pretty good. only had one delicious made-to-order omelette though because the wait was so long i gave up. no signage when you arrive telling you where to park your car while you check in. but a good experience overall, and with the prime location, i would stay there again.beachlounger2008,we are thrilled to hear the hyatt house met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. im glad you were able to take advantage of the ready-to-order omelet, complimentary breakfast spread in the morning and rooftop terrace in the evening. its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. we look forward to your next visit in seattle!sarah junge","location, location, location!"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"what a disappointing stay- fell far below expectations, which weren't so high to begin with. the only thing this hotel has going for it is the excellent location. otherwise, i found the front desk to be mostly unprofessional (with a few exceptions) and a little too casual.the room was comfortable and generally fine, in terms of condition, apart from the surprising lack of a safe! having to store valuables with the reception felt inconvenient and outdated. the room was also a bit noisy due to a parking garage across the street that sounded a small siren noise every time a vehicle exited. surely the hotel can negotiate this to be removed or install better noise insulation on that side of the buildingbut my biggest beef was the breakfast, which was simply mediocre at best and unreliable from one day to the next. two of the three mornings, there was no fresh fruit to be had... and there was generally no healthy food to be found. the overall quality of the food reminded me of a school cafeteria and was very limited in choice.",expected more.
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"great location, stayed here for 1 night. a short walk to the water front but longer back as up hill. great night life locally. breakfast in the morning was better then expected, the room was a twin room and was perfect with great views of the tower. staff very help full.robbo3556,we are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the hyatt house seattle downtown. i have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. safe travels we hope to see you again while visiting the area!sarah junge","so glad i booked here, will head straight back next time"

hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,i asked for my parking spot as a guest and they respond they were full and send me across the street to park my car to komo plaza and pay 60 usd by my own for 2 nights. at least i was expected any courtesy or a refund of 60 usd from the hotel.too bad.,no parking spot as a guest
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"i really enjoyed my stay at the hyatt house, the service is excellent and the rooms good. the rooms are spacious but more comparable to a studio apartment than a regular hotel room. the location even though it is next to the space needle is a tad bit inconvenient. there are very few decent restaurants in the area but having said that the hotel offers free transportation within a one mile radius of the hotel. additionally there is a monorail that goes from the space needle to downtown.the free breakfast buffet is comparable to most other hotels of this kind but the area was definitely more clean and organized than the norm.mark j,thank you for staying with us next to the space needle! we love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. as one of the newest members to the hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. we pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.sarah junge",comfortable rooms and good service
hyatt house seattle/downtown,1,"never had such bad experience before. stayed in this hotel for 9 nights, there were so many incidents happened during my stay.first night, i requested double room when i check in, they gave me three times twin room.and i asked for a room with the view, they said i have to pay 6usd extra, which i agreed, then i found it was much more than what i have been told. second night, i was being locked outside of my room. after changing the key card three times, they found out that it was the lock issue,they asked me to wait in the lobby till midnight, and then arranged me a room next door,which was not even cleaned thoroughly. yuk, imagine that sleeping at a room with someone else left belongings.third day, i was being notified that the lock of my room was fixed, so i can move back to my own room, such a relief, i was wondering what i am gonna do if i couldnt get back to my room, since all my stuffs are there. so i took a quick shower before going back to my room. guess what i have found out when i change back to my own room the door was left unlocked and nobody was there!!! i had to quick check if anything was missing. just when i decided to relax a bit in my room, someone came in my room without even knocking my door. he left immediately when he saw i was in the room without saying a word. i went to ask what that was for, he told me he just want to confirm if i need room service. i think that makes sense, and i answered yes, i need. but why didnt he knock first i went out for sightseeing during the day, when i get back to the room, it was exact the same as i left, nobody came to clean it. so i called them to ask why they didnt do the housekeeping since they came to my room specifically to ask if i require room service, which i answered yes, in the morning. they did send someone over to do it though after that phone call.fourth day, since i thought they just did the cleaning the late night before, i left my room with dnd sign on the door. guess what happened my room was cleaned!!! whats more, i was locked in the elevator for nearly ten minutes that night, and i had to call for help.fifth day, i found my credit card has been charged by the hotel with a strange amount of money. so i called them to ask why. the person who answered the phone said they will investigate and get back to me. i was waiting and waiting, still no answer, until i get back to the hotel at the night, i had to explain myself again with what happened to another their staff. yet, still no answer.sixth day, they charged my credit card again, which makes me so furious, since they just did whatever they want without asking for my permission. seventh day, after i called four times, finally, they found the reason why my credit card has been charged.because they didnt preauthrize enough money when i checked in, so they have to do it again and again. i said why it is different amount of money then, they couldnt give me a straight answer. and when i asked why they didnt inform me first yet, no straight answer.eighth night, i have been charged again, but i could guess what it was for already.the check out day was the most smooth day during my entire stay. i asked them to print my bill. and i am so glad that i did.to be fair, the location of this hotel is really nice, since it is just next to the space needle. the breakfast is too blunt. strong smell of the decoration for not only the lobby, also the room. but the attitude of their staff is really good. and they are actually quite helpful. so i wasnt going to write my experience until today when i saw the final invoice i was being charged around 60usd for parking fee. ironically, i dont even have a driving license, and i have never drove a car!!! this is soooooooo ridicules. i have stayed in many hotels in variety locations around the world, never suffered as badly as in this hotel. worst experience ever and super disappointed.dear mgx2222,thank you so much for choosing to stay at hyatt place during your recent trip to seattle. i would like to first and foremost apologize on behalf of the hotel and entire staff for the unsatisfactory experience you encounter during your recent visit. we really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. i could make excuses about the newness of the hotel and the lack of experience of our staff, but that doesnt rectify your inconvenience. its important for us to hear the feedback from our guests, as we want to improve and make the necessary changes that lead to positive experiences. we are addressing these concerns with the appropriate departments. we always want to be a part of great travel memories. please let us know when you come back to seattle as we would love to welcome you back!sincerely, sarah junge",worst experience ever

hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"this is one of the best hotels i have stayed at, if not the best. we stayed for 5 nights.the room was beautiful, with a high end modern design. we stayed in a king bed studio on the 8th floor, which was the top. the bathroom had a cool sliding door, and the shower was big and very nice. the comfortable bed was separated from the area with the couch with an awesome wall divider and a swiveling tv, which was very convenient. we didn't really utilize the kitchen because we ate the complimentary hotel breakfast which kept us full until we ate out for an early dinner everyday, but it is a great feature it had a microwave, stove, dishwasher, and a majority of the dishes, utensils, and pans you would need.speaking of the hotel breakfast, it was great. there were eggs and potatoes everyday, but they changed up the breakfast meat daily and alternated between pancakes and french toast. there were muffins, pastries, fruit, toast, cereal, oatmeal...the list goes on and on. you just have to get out of bed and get down there before it gets crazy, because the lines could be very long, and it got pretty crowded. the wait for an omelette was about half an hour usually, so i only got it once, but i like just regular scrambled eggs anyway, which was served daily. the staff worked hard to keep it stocked, but with an entire hotel full of people all trying to get food in a few hours, it could get frustrating to wait in line and see that what you wanted has run out temporarily when it got to be your turn. but overall, it was really nice with a great variety.our room was on the side of the building that faced the space needle, which was right across the street. it was a great view of the space needle itself and of the hillsides of the surrounding area. the door to the rooftop patio was right across the hall from our room, which was great and super convenient, and didn't add any noise whatsoever. there were fire pits, ample seating, tables, and a great view on the roof.the location was great, made even better by the hotel shuttle, which will take you up to a mile away from the hotel, and pick you up as well. the shuttle drivers were amazing and kind, and this service was super helpful. for the first couple of days we walked everywhere, but that came with sore, blistered feet, so it was nice to be driven closer to our destinations. the park surrounding the space needle was really nice, and super close. when we didn't want to commit to a full-on adventure, but wanted to get out and about, we would just walk across the street and explore the park and sit by the giant dome fountain, which changes how it sprays the water and was super fun to watch, and if you want to get wet, play in.a downside to the stay was the slow elevators. the first couple of days, it could take 5 minutes or more for the elevator to come, but after a lot of people seemingly checked out after the weekend, it got a lot better, but there was definitely a wait. being on the top floor, although awesome, may have contributed to this, as when you got on the elevator it went pretty quick, so maybe it was busy with the lower floors before it went up to us.the cherry on top was the staff. everyone, and i mean everyone, was so nice and helpful. the people who ran the front desk were always polite and helpful with any of our questions whether it was over the phone or at the desk.we had a great time, and would love to come back to this hotel.dear travelingrachel1,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your visit on tripadvisor. we are so happy to hear that you created wonderful memories, enjoyed the views of the iconic space needle from your guest room and relaxed on the rooftop terrace right outside your front door. i will pass on your kind words to the staff, i know they will be over the moon with excitement that they truly made a difference. we are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. please let us know when you plan on retuning to seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!sincerely, sarah junge",fantastic experience!

hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"i cannot recommend this hotel enough. there are so many hotels to choose from near the space needle and i am so glad i picked this one. it's location can't be beat. (literally across the street from the space needle). ashaunti checked me in early and the staff went above and beyond to welcome me on my birthday weekend with a card and box of goodies. it was lovely! the complimentary hot breakfast with omelet bar can't be beat to start the day. there is a wide variety of food and beverage for breakfast and always coffee/tea/lemon water in the lobby. it's a newer hotel and is energy efficient. i love the security measure of needing a room key to use the elevator. everyone greets you with a smile and hello. the room is clean and spacious and the bed is super comfortable. there is free wifi and also a free shuttle to anywhere within 1 mile. if you're going to seattle for the space needle, chihuly, public market, etc you must stay at the hyatt house. it is a wonderful hotel!!","highly recommended, great location"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"we arrived quite early so weren't surprised that we couldn't check in. we were told the room was clean but hadn't been inspected yet. we took the shuttle to pike place market for a long lunch then put our 85-year-old mother in an uber to go back to the hotel. it still hadn't been inspected so she had to sit in the lobby till it was ready. we were thrilled with our view of emp, space needle and chihuly garden. we had a 1-bedroom suite which is just a regular room with a partial wall to separate the sofa bed from the queen beds. we slept 6 fairly comfortably. twice when we wanted to shuttle back to the hotel we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone. in the afternoon it took over an hour to finally get a shuttle and since it was a different driver he had a different pick-up place. we almost missed it but happened to look around the corner and half a block up then ran to catch it. after dinner when we again couldn't get through to the desk we called central reservations because they always answer the phone. they tried for 20 minutes to get through to our hotel and couldn't. they finally told us to take a taxi or an uber and we would be reimbursed. sure enough - standard practice. when we got back to the hotel the only person at the front desk told his sad story of being so tired and groggy because he had worked a graveyard shift the night before and was the only person at the desk for 2 hours. there was the shuttle driver sitting with nothing to do because if no one answers the phone and finds out where he needs to go he can't actually go anywhere. very frustrating! on the plus side - breakfast was very good. this place is way overpriced though (over 400 for one night) and not the standard one expects from a hyatt.dear jenh,thank you for taking the time to review the hyatt house seattle and thank you very much for the feedback. we will use your comments to improve our hotels operations. i am sorry that your room was not ready by the time you returned for your day out. also to hear your experience with our front desk and shuttle staff is disheartening. the issues you experience will be addressed. again i apologize that your stay did not go smoothly as it should have. i hope that you will give us another opportunity the next time you are in town and feel free to contact me directly so i can assist with your next stay personally. sincerely,jonathan","great view, comfortable room, grossly understaffed"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"it's a nice hotel, but could use some work. staff is clearly overworked and they seem short handed. only 2-elevators and one was not working one day i was there. only one goes to the parking garage. one day breakfast was basically out of food by 8:30am, and it goes until 9:30. 45-min wait for a 1-egg omelet at the omelet bar. rooms are very clean, showers are weak, but a nice size. bed was good, towels were good. nice to have a full kitchen even if i did not use it. tv selection is limited, less than most hotels. rooms were very quiet, could not hear the street noise too much. ask in advance if you want a view other than a tram and mc.donalds. the space needle is on the other side. overall if you can get a good rate, it's worth booking. no room service at this location.",clean hotel - nice jr. suites - safe parking (overpriced)
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"we stayed here on returning from our alaska cruise. i want to initially point out that this is expensive, our room was 289++all of the taxes 329.00. the hyatt is nice but the reason for the price is that you can walk across the street to the space needle, chihoulys' museum of glass, the science center and other seattle attractions. you are also within a healthy persons walking distance to pike place market. i will say the room was very nice and ours had a view of the space needle. there is a nice breakfast complete with an omlette station. one of the nicer brekkes that we have experience in a hotel. during the day the dining room is also a restaurant which was quite busy with the locals. after a full day at the needle, chihouleys, the science center ect. we stopped at the restaurant for a burger to consider for my burger blog. i ordered the hyatt burger as it appeared to be their signature burger 7.50. we had a little bit of a wait but nothing out of the ordinary. when the burger came it looked delicious and it was!! it wasn't fancy but the taste was phenomenal and i have rated this burger as the third best have ever had! hand patted patty seasoned to perfection, fresh crispy lettuce, thinly slice onion (tasted like a walla walla), firm ripe tomato, a secret sauce that i wish i knew how to duplicate (not ketchup and mayonaise). the simplicity of the burgers construction and the seasoning is the reason for what i call a resounding triumph! this burger is/was so (expletive deleted) excellent that both of us wolfed it down, i even enjoyed the lingering taste left behind. it was a shame to wash it down with a dark ale, but it even made the ale taste better. then we received a bonus surprise. because we waited too long for the burger (didn't seem like it) the meal was comped. wow, one of the best burgers in the world and it was free. that never happens, but it did this visit. after learning of the comp, i had to share with the waitress and cook just how fine it truly was. i also told them to look for this review on trip advisor. i highly recommend that you stop here and have this burger if you are in the seattle area. i know i will !!dear beerdamage,thank you for taking the time out of your day to review the hyatt house downtown seattle! we very much appreciate your feedback. i am so glad to hear that you thought our hotels location and hbar was the best. i can tell from your trip advisor name that you must know a thing about beer and so the compliment is very much a welcome one. i will pass onto the hbar staff and the rest of my team your kind words. anytime we can make our guests stay a 5 star experience we know we succeeded! we sincerely appreciate the recommendation on our awesome burgers as well. we very much hope to see you again soon not just as our guests at hotel but in our hbar! sincerely,jon","amazing location, amazing burger"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"excellent hotel in downtown across from space-needle, museums, eateries and other services. couldn't be happier with accommodations and customer service. room was comfy, clean and quiet. we were part of large group that traveled across the county for a wedding. rooms are set up with stools at a kitchen island along the sofa arrangement in living area, create a larger sitting area, making rooms comfortable for several people to meet or just for two to lounge comfortably in room between activities. larger hang out areas available in lobby and roof top make it a great place for a large group to mingle. staff was super nice, helping with early check-in an holding our luggage for several hours after our check-out. continental breakfast was a nice variety, hot and fresh. only thing i would change is to have lounge/restaurant area open for at least light lunch options and stay open through night. currently after breakfast it is closed and reopens at 4pm.","great location, great service, great stay!"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,located right across the street from the space needle it's a great choice to stay in seattle. downtown is just a couple of minutes driving or 15 minutes walking.our room had a small kitchen but the only bad thing is that aparently you need to bring your own pillows if you want to rest properly because the ones they have are terrible.,great location
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"to describe who is writing this, i was a single traveller with a 3-person party one floor down. my basic expectations are: clean-no trace of previous guests, good bed with bleach-white sheets. i don't really expect to be hosted, or served well, just not rudely. i didn't want to detract from my overall satisfaction with the accommodations, so i gave 5 stars. here are a couple of downsides: the desk person who checked us in was not fabulous. our party had split up for check-in, as there is nowhere for any parking besides the basement, and mcdonald's across the street, she decided to get tough with my mother, who had paid for the accommodations, and insist that the would not surrender all room keys until all parties were present. even though we are all responsible adults. so she had to walk across a downtown street, get me, and return to get a second room key, which was a bit wierd. when checking in, she asked if i needed a room with a view this sounded like an offer, so i asked if it would cost my mom less. no. the prices are all the same for that room type. do you need a room with a view at this point i'm a bit bothered and a bit offended, because she has avoided simply asking if she could give me an interior room as a favour to the hotel, which i would have gladly obliged, but it was starting to sound like special request - room with a view like i had requested a crib. she also gave us the usual pre-flight bathrooms down the hall blah-blah, never cracking a smile. she never mentioned that the elevators are super-confusing, with only one going down to the parade, so if you hit down from floor 7, you might get the lobby only car, might not, it's completely random. even if it seems no one else is using the elevators at all. the stairs will not take you past floor 1 so us skip the wait and run the stairs folks do not have that option. so after check-in, we accidentally boarded the top-to-lobby elevator, trying to get down to the parade, and had a super-confusing time learning all these facts as we went. so ask how the elevators work, please. i took the interior room, which faces windows to the hall and other rooms. in such a room, it would be easy to accidentally see or be seen by other guests. in the afternoon i was watching tv, and could easily see the cleaning lady in the room across, the windows are only perhaps 8 feet apart. so privacy screen down, blackout shades pretty much all the time. otherwise this property is gorgeous, has a charming rooftop courtyard with bbq and firepit, the fitness facility is ok, and the breakfast is included and hyatt standard which i love! you should know that you cannot get access to the parade in any way without a key, my mom lost the key while sorting out the rooms, and we got stuck with a car behind us while she had a panic attack. a phone attached to the card reader links you to the front desk.......eventually. very eventually.cclelland2016,we are thrilled to hear the hyatt house met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. im glad you were able to take advantage of the rooftop terrace, fitness center and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. we look forward to your next visit in seattle!sarah junge",fabulous hotel under the space needle

hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"we stayed at the hyatt house for five days at the end of june, a scant two weeks after the hotel opened. it is located on fifth street and fronts seattle center.room: the room was well designed. it is designed for longer stays and thus has some basic utensils, cook top and dishwasher. we didn't do any cooking but it was convenient to have a freezer compartment that actually worked. we availed ourselves of some ice cream from downstairs and kept the remainder in the freezer for the next night. the bed was very comfortable, better than most hotels. the shower was large. we saw some electronic controls on the wall that simply said my. it turned out that they were for the electric blind controls on the windows. it seemed to us that travelers shouldn't have to guess what controls in a room do. they should be labeled. this is a small complaint for a room that otherwise was well designed and quiet. we slept well here.internet: i tested the up and download speeds and got 33 megs down and almost the same speed for upload. very good internet function and was easy to logon.housekeeping: we did not get any housekeeping one night and on another a harried housekeeper who was supposed to get off at 4 pm knocked on our door at 830 pm and asked if we needed service. they seem to be short of housekeepers and it struck us that they are asking the housekeepers to do too much. i suspect that they are not paid enough either. morning breakfast: the breakfast was quite good. we often stay at the hampton inn down the street and the food here was much better quality. you even get real scrambled eggs here versus egg food. the juices were good and cold. they have an innovative cooling table that all of the juices sit on and it worked well. the design of the eating area could be improved. sadly, now that this hotel is open it will be unlikely that changes will be made. they store the plates overhead in the middle of the buffet line. it is an awkward place to have them and would be difficult to access for shorter customers. the buffet line area is too narrow. when people are on the omelet side they often bump into the people on the other side. this seems like an odd oversight. you would think architects for hyatt would have this down by now. overall though, the food was quite good and included in the price of the room.hotel design: the main lobby area is quite pleasing to look at and use. there are ample chairs with modern design and were quite comfortable. the check in desk was ok but i often wonder why they make their staff stand all day. hyatt could take a cue from hilton hotels in this regard. the snack kiosk next to the check in desk was well stocked and we used it several times. the hotel elevators are inadequate. they only have two elevators. there often were lengthy waits, particularly on the weekend when the hotel was fully booked. this is another flaw that can't be remedied and it is a surprise again that the architect failed so badly on this item. there is only one elevator that goes to the parking garage, the one on the left, again a miss. the garage is oddly designed, probably because the hotel is on a triangularly shaped lot. even though we had a compact car, the parking spaces are far too narrow making it difficult for parking and getting in and out of your vehicle. you also have to make a 90 degree turn to either enter or exit the garage, this is after you descend the steep entry. there are some large bolts protruding from the card reader mount at the bottom of the garage entrance. since you have to make a sharp turn on leaving i can see that someone with a larger vehicle may run over one of these and puncture a tire. fortunately for seattle, it snows infrequently, but i could see where some blowing snow could drift down into the very steep parking garage entrance. someone entering could then slide all the way to the bottom where they would hit the roll up door.staff: the staff were pleasant and helpful. they looked fatigued and understaffed. i suspect this will improve as the bring more employees on board. we saw one manager who was on duty all day and was there at least until 10 pm when we walked through the lobby. he was there again the next morning when i left the hotel at 0800.miscellaneous: they accept dogs here. there is a 75 charge per stay. this seems steep if you only stay for one night. we had no problems with our golden retriever and it was conveniently close to the seattle center for dog bathroom breaks. pickup bags are available on the street. summary: we would likely stay here again when we visit seattle. i suspect the start up problems will be resolved soon. the morning breakfast was quite good but they need to resort things so that access is better. the rooms overall were great, well designed and comfortable. the staff are harried, hopefully they will have an adequate number of employees soon. the hotels in seattle seem very highly priced. our room was 254 and i see now that the rate has risen to 400 per night. enjoy your stay in seattle, this is a hotel you would be very comfortable staying at!dear thomas k,thank you for

hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"we went to seattle for an event at the key center for my sons. the location of the hyatt house was ideal. walking distance for all of our activities (including very close to the monorail which made easy access to light rail and pioneer square activities as well). the staff at the hyatt house were outstanding. very friendly and helpful. a couple issues (that should be easily fixable): 1) the keys for the doors (and the elevators) suck! i needed to switch mine out twice and from the people struggling to use them in the elevators, i know i wasn't the only one. we were told this is a new system so hopefully they can work out the bugs. it was very frustrating. 2) elevators. woof. during the busy morning times, it took forever! and it would have been easy to take the stairs but there is no access from the stairs to the ground floor without setting off a fire alarm. this seems like it would be any easy fix so hopefully they can do it soon because it was bad!jared80525,thank you for staying with us next to the seattle center! we love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. as one of the newest members to the hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback. i sincerely apologize about the inconveniences of the elevators and the door locks during your stay. please know we are diligently working on correcting these areas to improve our guest experience. your feedback is essential to us and we hope to have the opportunity as our guest once again. sarah junge",amazing location and staff a couple issues

hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"i don't usually do reviews, but we were very pleased with this hotel. it is literally right across the street from the space needle and a few walking blocks to the monorail to get downtown---could not have asked for a better location. we even walked down to olympic park. on top of that, our room was perfect---a small kitchen, 2 queen beds, and a comfy pull out sofa---perfect for my family of 4 (2 teenage daughters). the free breakfast in the morning was excellent. they had a big variety and you could even special order an omelet. my husband and i also enjoyed the evening happy hour. right next to the space needle is the armory with a wide variety of places to eat. this was a perfect, inexpensive option for our family. would definitely stay there again!!dear gail h,thank you very much for taking to write a review about your stay with us. we appreciate all the feedback we get. i am very happy to hear that you and your family found our hotel great and the hotels location, comfortable rooms and breakfast buffet. also that your husband enjoyed our awesome happy hour :) i will share with the staff your kind words and we will celebrate them. we know you have many choices of hotels to pick from here in seattle so we thank you for choosing hyatt house. it is great to hear you and your family would definitely stay with us again! we do appreciate your business! sincerely,jonathan",great place to stay
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,staff was very friendly and especially helpful. included breakfast was better than most hotel breakfasts. location is right at the foot of the space needle. public transportation (monorail and buses) were within a block of the hotel. the room had a refrigerator and microwave.,hyatt house
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"i took my 26 year old daughter for a birthday mini 5 day vacation to seattle. from the amazing warm staff , the beautiful suite with refrigerator, microwave, couch lounge area and two queen beds wow so well done! the staff at the front desk were all amazing and gave us great ideas to have a fun vacation even offering us ideas for free museum visits on thursdays. the breakfast and adorable chefs were so accommodating and wonderful omelettes also great variety of fruit, yogurts cereals and many other delightful treats! oh also free shuttle around 1 mile radius but able to walk and uber everywhere as well! top notch managing, customer service and a fun and amazing place to visit! we are from san diego and the rain and snow was a welcome change and absolute delight as many things inside but a change for us as well. do not miss snoqualmie falls( rent car from avis walking distance from hotel) for the day! also chihuly glass gardens so beautiful walking distance from hotel! thank you for an unforgettable trip camille, matt, spring, scotty, gregory , jen and anyone else we left out that works for the hotel! jl","beautiful room, incredible staff and amazing customer service!"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,3,"visiting seattle with my partner for an overnight stop on our trip down the west coast en route to california. the hotel check in staff were immediately unhelpful. i don't like the complexity of the car park and how badly sign posted it is. they should make provision for some limited parking whilst you check in but instead they leave you parked in front of the gate in limbo whilst someone in the party runs in to sort it. the room itself - a king on the 4th floor with views of the space needle - was large and comfortable with a good bed. the bathroom was, perhaps, a little basic - the toilet looked very down market and the shower had very poor pressure. some nicer quality toiletries would also be a nice touch at 400/night. that said, we both slept well - though both found the air con to be unnecessarily noisy. the microwave display is also so bright that i got up to unplug it so we could sleep. we aren't the types to need pitch black and silence to sleep but it's almost obnoxiously bright and a discernible blue hue is visible even with closed eyes. not good enough. the automatic blinds are a nice touch, however. breakfast was awful but checkout smooth. all in all.. meh.bhunjan,thank you for taking the time out of your schedule to complete this review regarding your recent stay at the hyatt house seattle downtown. please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response by continuing to focus on making each and every guest experience the best it can be. we hope to be of service to you in the future.sarah junge",pretty average
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"first off- you are *literally* across the street from the needle! you actually couldnt be closer. also to the chuhuly and mopop museums and the monorail. it was a great place to be based, a 15 minutes walk to pikes place. the room has a kitchenette with a full-size fridge/freezer. a two burner electric cooktop, pans and plates and flatware provided. we had a corner room by the monorail but didnt hear anything. had a little living area with a couch. more than enough room for two people. the breakfast was included and was great! made to order omelettes, yogurt, french toast, etc, etc. it was great to be able to cook for when you didnt feel like going out- though there is plenty right nearby! super comfy beds and nice blackout curtains. highly recommend!thank you for sharing your experience with us. i am very glad that you chose to make us your home base for your seattle adventure. please come back and see us again soon!","great location, great stay"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,1,"i entered the room with an overlook of the gas station next door, which was ok however the homeless guy that hung out and got drunk all weekend was the worst. i not only had to hear him from my room , but when i left the hotel to get something from the store i had to deal with him as well. it is clear the hotel cares for the front end of the building but won't deal with that back. not worth the stay.dear johntraveler1980,thank you for staying with us at the hyatt house seattle downtown. i genuinely apologize for the trouble you experienced at our hotel and appreciate the time you took to write this review. please know we continue to strive to meet all of our guests needs and expectations. please know the items brought to our attention are being addressed with the seattle police department. in the future, we hope you will give us another try and find your stay much improved to the last.sarah junge",worst homeless in the alley ever
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"the hyatt house is just steps away from great attractions such as the space needle, chihuly glass and garden, and the emp museum. the room was spacious and had a refrigerator and microwave. the hotel has a great rooftop lounge area with comfortable seating, firepits, and a beautiful view of the surrounding area. the free breakfast was delicious and included a good variety of food including made to order omelets, fruit, juices, etc. the only downside here is that the parking is a bit expensive and the lot itself is small and spaces are very tight. other than parking, i highly recommend this hotel.",perfect location
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"this was a great location and a short walk to see a concert at key arena. the rooms were nice and beds comfy. spacious shower. the breakfast was very good, buffet with lots of options and made to order omelets. the only negative would be the hotel bar. service was sub par. the bartender awkward and not attentive. took 40 mins to get our food and we were the only ones who looked like we were eating. we were never checked on. looked like a lot better places around the stadium to eat so stay at the hotel and avoid the bar/restaurant.",great location for concert at key arena
hyatt house seattle/downtown,1,"service, food and staff are the worse! what more can i say!!!the front desk staff was completely worthless, had no knowledge of any questions i asked! no bar as advertised! homeless people on the sidewalk of hotel. felt like i was in the wrong neighborhood for sure. don't stay there unless you want a dirty room and no service!",don't stay there!!!!!

hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"my teenage daughter had a dance across the emp and this was literally across the street ! the view is amazing and the place was very chill and for a hotel chain, it felt like a local neighborhood place as everyone at the front desk were so friendly and helpful particularly a shout out to the shy and very sweet matthew. they do have things you can borrow from weight scale to clothes steamer, but only a handful so it's usually checked out. parking downstairs but they have a 24 hour shuttle that can take you around town.petitejetsetter,it was a pleasure accommodating you recently at the hyatt house seattle downtown and we sincerely appreciate the glowing review! i have shared your feedback with the team (highlighting matthew) regarding your experience and will strive to make sure we are exceeding all of our guests expectations. please let us know when you visit next as we look forward to having you as our guest!sarah junge","great location, great hotel, and just amazing hospitality"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"every employer that i met at hyatt was incredibly helpful and friendly, especially the the chef who made the omlettes in the morning (delicious, by the way), mahdi, and the front desk people. i got put in here as part of corporate housing for an internship and was not sure what to expect but i couldn't have asked for a better experience.dear 373jkim,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories at our beautiful hotel. i will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will be bursting with excitement to know they made a difference. we are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. please let us know when you plan on retuning to seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!sincerely, sarah junge",awesome 3 week stay
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"we stayed here five nights. will stay again.the room was nice with a dinning area and small lounge with kitchen ( full size fridge, stove top, dish washer and pots and pans etc ) which helped as we bought so much food from the pike place market. we have two queen beds with a sofa bed. room was clean and bright, shower has high water pressure, beds were comfortable.the location is perfect to use the monorail. it is just less than 5 mins walk from the monorail station at seattle centre. the hotel has a downtown shuttle within a one mile radius which include pike place market but it is always very busy and require booking and often long wait.breakfast was included it was pretty good for complimentary breakfast, with omelet station, fruit juice, pancake, fruits etc.the small things that make it not deserving of a perfect score was 1) the very poor wifi, 2) the breakfast was always busy with long queue and no seats 3) only two lifts for such a full capacity hotel hence long wait 4) staffs rarely ever smile and not very helpful - we asked for a shower cap and have had to call twice and went down to reception in person once before we finally get it and about one hour later. however we understand that it was because the hotel was very busy. the only staff who made us feel welcome and went out of his way to get a taxi for us was wayne - thank you!",nice hotel and happy stay but service can be improved
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"hotel location is excellent. free breakfast is good/great and generous. staff were amazingly friendly and accommodating. would stay here again in a heartbeat. we had a room facing the space needle, which was a great bonus (request it at check in, if you can). getting the city pass was a great bonus, as most of the attractions are literally across the street. monorail station is in seattle center and connects to light rail, so you can go to and from the airport in about 30-45 minutes. very easy.stevenci5388rf,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. i will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. we are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. please let us know when you plan on returning to seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!sarah junge","great value, great location"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,the hotel is new and the rooms are very nice butthe waiting time for the elevator in the morning can be up to 20 minthe que for breakfast is so long and you cant even get a seatno poolrooftop is closed in winterthe free shuttle bus... you need to wait from 30-45 min for 5 min drive and 15 min walkhouse keeping do very little - room was not cleaned as expected when you call the reception it takes 5-10 min to be answered,great location lousy service
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"this is a long-term stay hotel, so our room came with a kitchenette and small living room with a sofa and coffee table. we only stayed there for three nights, so didn't make use of the extra space, but it was nice to have room to move around. the reception desk was helpful and friendly. breakfast was great, but skip the omelet bar. the line was too long, and it took forever. there were plenty of other options available (cereal, fruit, pastries, potatoes, eggs, oatmeal...). the complimentary shuttle was great for sightseeing. we took it to pike place and downtown saved on taxis and uber. housekeeping could be more attentive, but since our stay was brief and we're not slobs, it was fine. can't beat the location - literally across the street from the space needle and chihuly.mistybunny,thank you for staying with us next to the space needle! we love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. as one of the newest members to the hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. we pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.sarah junge","roomy rooms, great amenities"

hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"we stayed at the hyatt house for five days at the end of june, a scant two weeks after the hotel opened. it is located on fifth street and fronts seattle center.room: the room was well designed. it is designed for longer stays and thus has some basic utensils, cook top and dishwasher. we didn't do any cooking but it was convenient to have a freezer compartment that actually worked. we availed ourselves of some ice cream from downstairs and kept the remainder in the freezer for the next night. the bed was very comfortable, better than most hotels. the shower was large. we saw some electronic controls on the wall that simply said my. it turned out that they were for the electric blind controls on the windows. it seemed to us that travelers shouldn't have to guess what controls in a room do. they should be labeled. this is a small complaint for a room that otherwise was well designed and quiet. we slept well here.internet: i tested the up and download speeds and got 33 megs down and almost the same speed for upload. very good internet function and was easy to logon.housekeeping: we did not get any housekeeping one night and on another a harried housekeeper who was supposed to get off at 4 pm knocked on our door at 830 pm and asked if we needed service. they seem to be short of housekeepers and it struck us that they are asking the housekeepers to do too much. i suspect that they are not paid enough either. morning breakfast: the breakfast was quite good. we often stay at the hampton inn down the street and the food here was much better quality. you even get real scrambled eggs here versus egg food. the juices were good and cold. they have an innovative cooling table that all of the juices sit on and it worked well. the design of the eating area could be improved. sadly, now that this hotel is open it will be unlikely that changes will be made. they store the plates overhead in the middle of the buffet line. it is an awkward place to have them and would be difficult to access for shorter customers. the buffet line area is too narrow. when people are on the omelet side they often bump into the people on the other side. this seems like an odd oversight. you would think architects for hyatt would have this down by now. overall though, the food was quite good and included in the price of the room.hotel design: the main lobby area is quite pleasing to look at and use. there are ample chairs with modern design and were quite comfortable. the check in desk was ok but i often wonder why they make their staff stand all day. hyatt could take a cue from hilton hotels in this regard. the snack kiosk next to the check in desk was well stocked and we used it several times. the hotel elevators are inadequate. they only have two elevators. there often were lengthy waits, particularly on the weekend when the hotel was fully booked. this is another flaw that can't be remedied and it is a surprise again that the architect failed so badly on this item. there is only one elevator that goes to the parking garage, the one on the left, again a miss. the garage is oddly designed, probably because the hotel is on a triangularly shaped lot. even though we had a compact car, the parking spaces are far too narrow making it difficult for parking and getting in and out of your vehicle. you also have to make a 90 degree turn to either enter or exit the garage, this is after you descend the steep entry. there are some large bolts protruding from the card reader mount at the bottom of the garage entrance. since you have to make a sharp turn on leaving i can see that someone with a larger vehicle may run over one of these and puncture a tire. fortunately for seattle, it snows infrequently, but i could see where some blowing snow could drift down into the very steep parking garage entrance. someone entering could then slide all the way to the bottom where they would hit the roll up door.staff: the staff were pleasant and helpful. they looked fatigued and understaffed. i suspect this will improve as the bring more employees on board. we saw one manager who was on duty all day and was there at least until 10 pm when we walked through the lobby. he was there again the next morning when i left the hotel at 0800.miscellaneous: they accept dogs here. there is a 75 charge per stay. this seems steep if you only stay for one night. we had no problems with our golden retriever and it was conveniently close to the seattle center for dog bathroom breaks. pickup bags are available on the street. summary: we would likely stay here again when we visit seattle. i suspect the start up problems will be resolved soon. the morning breakfast was quite good but they need to resort things so that access is better. the rooms overall were great, well designed and comfortable. the staff are harried, hopefully they will have an adequate number of employees soon. the hotels in seattle seem very highly priced. our room was 254 and i see now that the rate has risen to 400 per night. enjoy your stay in seattle, this is a hotel you would be very comfortable staying at!dear thomas k,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your visit on tripadvisor. we are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout

hyatt house seattle/downtown,3,"as another reviewer wrote a pro - con list, i have a similar list. we had a suite with 2 queen beds and a pullout couch. travelling were 2 adults, a 15 yr old and a 12 yr old.pros:1. very large rooms2. free wifi service3. free daily breakfast with very good selections and omelet station4. slightly larger than bar fridge in the rooms with coffee maker, dishwasher, utensils, plates, pots, microwave.5. across the street from mcdonald's.6. 5 min walk from qfc market7. across the street from space needle, emp museum8. helpful and courteous staff9. large flat screen tv with good selection of channels.10. free shuttle to locations within 5 min of driving11. we got a good view of the seafair parade as it went by the hotel.12. 6-7 min walk to several casual restaurants cons:1. parking is expensive, 30 usd/day (after taxes)2. you only have access to the parking lot from one of two elevators. the elevator has an entrance and a control panel on each side. you need your room key to operate it but only one side of the elevator has a sensor. 3. if you don't want to take the elevator (because there is always a long wait in the morning with people checking out and wanting to eat the free breakfast) you can't take the stairs even if you're on the 2nd floor as it is used only as an emergency exit and goes outside and not to the lobby. also the exit door is alarmed. 4. housekeeping didn't come clean our room until after 5 everyday which was annoying when you just want to relax if you've been out for the day.5. they only give you 1 small bottle of shampoo and conditioner unless you request more.dear oombellathank you for taking the time out of your schedule to complete this review regarding your recent stay at the hyatt house seattle downtown. please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response by continuing to focus on making each and every guest experience the best it can be. we hope to be of service to you in the future.sarah junge",pretty good but not the best

hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"while the hotel is clean and in an excellent location, you will not get a good night's sleep here if you have neighbors above you who need to fulfill their 10,000 daily steps in the middle of the night. of the four nights we stayed here all four nights were full of different neighbors above us who for some reason need to walk back and forth around their room all night long, banging cabinets, doors, etc. complaints to the house host were not helpful at all. we never got a decent night sleep here. also, don't believe the shuttle stuff. we tried every day to get one, first being told just call 10 mins before you need one, then told you must come downstairs in person and wait, and oh by the way it would be a 40 min wait (when the shuttle only goes a 1 mile radius i do not understand). never was able to get a shuttle the entire time we were there. the staff at the morning buffet were wonderful, friendly, but the hot food was not hot, the selection was small. and lastly, take the stairs. the elevator is s-l-o-w. we often waited more than 5 minutes. i would not stay here again, mostly because of the noise factor.hello, julie!thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. we are sorry to hear that you did not get a good nights sleep - that's the exact opposite of what we are shooting for! noise complaints are relatively uncommon for us, and we will investigate a bit to see if anything can be done about the particular room you stayed in. i am sorry too to hear of your experience with the shuttle. i know it seems crazy, but with traffic sometimes a shuttle run for several passengers within a mile can take much longer than expected. it sounds like we could have done a much better job communicating with you though. we appreciate the feedback and will certainly use it as a training opportunity internally. thank you again and we hope to have the chance to serve you again - with a good nights sleep!","be forewarned, ceilings are thin... you will hear neighbors"

hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"we stayed at the hyatt house because it was convenient to the emp, as we were taking a vocal workshop. the room had greasy fingerprints all over the microwave, chairs around the bar were askew, and the shower was dirty with large spots of soap scum all over it. we called the front desk and they asked if they could clean it the next day! we said, no, we are checking out then and want to take a shower in the morning. they said they would send someone up. i pulled back the covers on the bed to make sure the sheets had been changed and there was a plastic wrapper and a dirty wash rag. needless to say, we went downstairs and said, please put us in another room. the next room was not very clean either, but better than the first one.kimbrleedo,feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns. we strive to exceed all of our guests expectations and know we still have some work to do. please know this is extremely important to me and i'm working with my executive housekeeper to correct any issues. please let us know if there is anything we further assist with - we look forward to another opportunity to serve you in the future.sarah junge",poor housekeeping
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"we stayed here thursday, march 24, 2016, in a king view room and would definitely stay again (and i look forward to the opportunity to do so). first, the location is great. we were there for a concert at key arena so it was wonderful getting out of a show at midnight knowing we only had to walk about a block back to our hotel.our room was on the fifth floor (509) with a view of the space needle emp. the kitchen had a center bar with two chairs a small sink dishwasher stovetop microwave and mini-fridge/freezer. in addition, it was stocked with all the basics (including pots, pans cutlery strainer grater dish soap paper towels and towel). there were also containers for recycling.the sectional in the separated living area was quite comfy, and the tv could be turned for viewing either there or from the bed area. our bed was comfortable with ample pillows and a spare with another blanket in the closet (as well as an ironing board). the shower was large with a large shower head. in addition, there were ample outlets, places to set luggage etc., and a few non-standard wall hangings. we just stayed overnight, but i can see it being a perfect spot for longer stays.one thing we both commented on more than once was how quiet it was - whatever soundproofing efforts hyatt made, they really paid off. if we didn't know we were in a busy hotel on a busy city street, we would've never guessed by the lack of external sounds. the only noise we heard was whatever we made ourselves. throw in the light blocking shades they had it makes for a great night's sleep.there is self-parking there for 25/night (close to 30 after tax is added), but i thought that reasonable for a full afternoon to late morning parking across from the seattle center (mine started at 2:00 p.m. when i checked in as i was able to get an early check in and ended about 11 a.m. when we left - although check out is a nice comfortable noon).we didn't get chance to try the bar although it looked comfortable and the menu looked good so i'd like to the next time. the free breakfast set up is in the same area, but we also didn't take advantage of that. here's a few minuses (and i consider them very minor and they definitely wouldn't keep us from staying again as the pluses way outweigh the nitpicking below):we noticed a fitness room as we walked to dinner, although we didn't have chance to use it. it did have glass windows out onto 5th ave, however, which would be a bit too public for my style.there are only two elevators, and they can be a bit slow. when we went to check out, we checked both elevators on the 5th floor, but neither had garage access (of course, maybe we missed it in one, but we both commented it was weird and had waited for the 2nd one when we discovered the first didn't have it - only to be surprised the second didn't either - again, maybe we're idiots :). anyway, we had to take one elevator to the lobby, get off, wait for the second, then get that one to the garage.also, our keys worked everywhere, just not in the elevator the first few times (another woman riding with us had the same issue - we got lucky when others got it so we could get to our floor once they activated it). anyway, i stopped to ask the front desk, and the trick is to hold it not swipe it. after that we didn't have any problems.that's one of the minuses, though, i thought the front desk staff, although very friendly and professional, could've given just a bit more thorough information at check in (like check in/out times how to use the card in the elevator how to manage the luggage carts where amenities were, etc.). the loading zone out front was full when i went by the first time, so i had to circle the block a couple times (which can be tricky in that area - especially since you're not supposed to take a right at fifth denny which would make it truly annoying if you didn't decide you didn't see that no-right sign - just sayin'). the luggage carts were there in the entry on 5th ave but none were in the parking area. i thought about unloading having them hold my cart/luggage till i was parked, but i didn't see a ramp down to the loading zone on 5th (maybe there is one but i just didn't catch it). so, i just made two trips carrying stuff rather than one to go up get the cart, bring it down, take it up bring it back down. it would be nice if there was a better setup than that. my other hotel bug-a-boos, and this isn't just here but other places i've recently been, there's only one caffeinated coffee package in the room (and two de-caffeinated). i know i could go down to the breakfast area for coffee, but we slept late. thank goodness my spouse doesn't drink coffee. the other bug-a-boo is low-flow shower heads. i know, i know, it's the good thing to do, but it's so disappointing to have a salad plate sized shower head only to find it lacks shower power. the bottom line is that hotels in downtown seattle aren't cheap, and we found this hyatt to be a great value for the money spent. overall, we had a great time that night and in no small way the hyatt contributed to our enjoyable evening. we will definitely stay again.kimbb418,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. i will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. we are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. please let us know when you plan on returning to seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!sarah junge",sound sleep sound choice
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,the hotel is only 1 1/2 years old. modern rooms with kitchen and living room. the one we had looked at the space needle which was across the road. the staff were excellent. a free breakfast buffet with a large selection. only thing that were negative was there was no pool and you could hear the people upstairs. however when we complained about the noise the staff did something about it. would go back for sure.,really nice hotel with great location

hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"when we told the front desk about the lack of hot water they said they'd known and were working on it. we didn't have much hot water in our two days. no cell reception in center rooms. no natural light - if we opened our shades we were looking directly into our neighbors' bedroom. it's really too bad as the staff is friendly and the rooms are spacious. you can't beat the location. they offer complimentary shuttle service within a mile, which is helpful, and a cooked breakfast but the eggs are disgusting.","no hot water, no cell reception"
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,the best place i've stayed while travelling abroad. the staff are friendly and approachable. the room was amazing! they have a great continental breakfast that's so much more than just a few muffins. and the location is ideal. you're out of the downtown core but the monorail is right there. the space needle is right across the street and lots of good restaurants just around the corner. we got in really early and they checked our bags so we could explore while they got our room ready and we did the same thing leaving as we had a late train departure and they were happy to keep our bags while we spent the afternoon out and about. i have nothing but good things to say about hyatt house.,my seattle home away from home
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"i visited with my husband and 16 yr old daughter and best friend and her family. we each got suites with a view before an alaska cruise. the rooms are clean, large and well decorated-exceeded all expectations. the breakfast is good. not fantastic but a nice way to start the day. the super bar is friendly and reasonable-we did not try the food. the location is excellent-seattle is such a good walking city (this was our first time)- its walking distance from most places and still in a pretty quiet spot. our room had a view of the space needle. what makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. the people were simply fantastic-truly customer focused and just plain kind. we had booked the rooms nine months in advance at a 40 discount from the current rate . we were meeting other friends (mom and two teens) that had booked air bnb. by 11 pm they still had not been able to reach their host and were threatening sleeping in their car. because we had a suite that sleeps six, i asked them to stay in our room. i went to the front desk to explain the situation, ask for bedding -credit card in hand. they were wonderful. they saw how desperate we were, chuckled and smiled and asked what kind of bedding we needed and waved away my card (hope i am not getting anyone in trouble). the bedding was there in 10 min. ive never experienced such warm hospitality and i am truly grateful. thanks for a memorable and wonderful visit!",what a delight
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,located right across the street from the space needle it's a great choice to stay in seattle. downtown is just a couple of minutes driving or 15 minutes walking.our room had a small kitchen but the only bad thing is that aparently you need to bring your own pillows if you want to rest properly because the ones they have are terrible.,great location
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"great location to stay pre-cruise if you want to visit seattle. it is directly across the street from the space needle, science museum, emp, and an easy walk to pikes market, as well as parks along the water for running or walking (to get some exercise we actually walked to pier 91 which was our cruise terminal). we had a spacious 1 bedroom unit (with bedroom door that closes versus the smaller suite that just has a dividing wall and is a bit cramped) w/pullout couch, 2 queens, large well lit bathroom, full kitchen with stove, full size fridge, and microwave. the large unit also has a full living room and a kitchen table that doubles as a desk with plenty of outlets. the beds were comfortable and the suite had 3 tvs (bedroom, living room, kitchen). the small suite (which we did not have but my sister did) has a much smaller kitchen with mini fridge in the kitchen table and only 1 tv that swivels between the bedroom and living room. the beds were comfortable. good security in that you need your room key to access any of the floors with rooms. a breakfast buffet is included with a pretty good selection. my favorite part was the omelette station. as soon as you enter the breakfast area, fill out the order sheet indicating what you want on your omelette, and the cook will make it up exactly as ordered. i had this two days in a row and they were delicious. the omelettes are a bit small, but really the perfect size. they also had a great selection of name brand cereal and fresh fruit (among other items). the hotel also arranged car service for us (it is with ace transportation...which is not the same as the one online). it was 70 plus tip. the service call you when the plane lands and tell you to call them when you get your luggage. we then waited about 15 minutes for the driver to pick us up. i'm not sure what the taxi's are like, but that option may be easier without the wait. we arranged for the car service in advance since we had 5 people and 5 suitcases...and it was nice having a large clean suv. the hotel also arranged for us to have ace shuttle us to pier 91 for 8 per person. we thought this would be the same type of service but it wasn't. this was an actual shuttle van that we shared with another family. when we checked out at 12:00 we were expecting it to be there waiting for us (due to our prior arrangement) but the front desk had to call and check on it. we probably waited about 15 minutes for them to show up...but the pier is close (2-3 miles) so not a big deal. due to all the intersections it took about 15-20 minutes to get there. the hyatt also has a free shuttle within a mile (to and from) of the hotel. they will come when you request it - be sure to tip if you use that service.other nice items: all staff were very friendly, walgreens is close-by for snacks and sodas and any forgotten items, monorail is close by, coin operated washer / dryer, free wifi, neighborhood has lots of small restaurants around.minor items that would be nice if they had (but they don't): more hooks in the bathroom to hang towels in so that you can more easily reuse them, a makeup mirror, a safe for locking up laptops, ipads, etc. (if you need a safe you have to go to the front desk).dear brenda s,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories and made the most of our amenities in our beautiful hotel and city. i will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will be so happy to know they made a difference. we are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. please let us know when you plan on retuning to seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!sincerely, sarah junge",loved hyatt house for our pre-cruise visit!

hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"what a disappointing stay- fell far below expectations, which weren't so high to begin with. the only thing this hotel has going for it is the excellent location. otherwise, i found the front desk to be mostly unprofessional (with a few exceptions) and a little too casual.the room was comfortable and generally fine, in terms of condition, apart from the surprising lack of a safe! having to store valuables with the reception felt inconvenient and outdated. the room was also a bit noisy due to a parking garage across the street that sounded a small siren noise every time a vehicle exited. surely the hotel can negotiate this to be removed or install better noise insulation on that side of the buildingbut my biggest beef was the breakfast, which was simply mediocre at best and unreliable from one day to the next. two of the three mornings, there was no fresh fruit to be had... and there was generally no healthy food to be found. the overall quality of the food reminded me of a school cafeteria and was very limited in choice.",expected more.

hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,well we arrived in our taxi to be greeted by a very spacious clean looking modern hotel. the reception staff dealt with our needs efficiently and in a friendly manor and our rooms were large fresh and well presented. although the bar staff did and efficient job with drinks when placing food orders it took an absolute age to be served. we actually thought they had forgotten us they state onsite parking in their description but there is an extra charge for this when you arrive :-(. still the space needle is right outside and its close to many other attractions so would definitely recommend a stay.,first stop on our us tour

hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"great location to stay pre-cruise if you want to visit seattle. it is directly across the street from the space needle, science museum, emp, and an easy walk to pikes market, as well as parks along the water for running or walking (to get some exercise we actually walked to pier 91 which was our cruise terminal). we had a spacious 1 bedroom unit (with bedroom door that closes versus the smaller suite that just has a dividing wall and is a bit cramped) w/pullout couch, 2 queens, large well lit bathroom, full kitchen with stove, full size fridge, and microwave. the large unit also has a full living room and a kitchen table that doubles as a desk with plenty of outlets. the beds were comfortable and the suite had 3 tvs (bedroom, living room, kitchen). the small suite (which we did not have but my sister did) has a much smaller kitchen with mini fridge in the kitchen table and only 1 tv that swivels between the bedroom and living room. the beds were comfortable. good security in that you need your room key to access any of the floors with rooms. a breakfast buffet is included with a pretty good selection. my favorite part was the omelette station. as soon as you enter the breakfast area, fill out the order sheet indicating what you want on your omelette, and the cook will make it up exactly as ordered. i had this two days in a row and they were delicious. the omelettes are a bit small, but really the perfect size. they also had a great selection of name brand cereal and fresh fruit (among other items). the hotel also arranged car service for us (it is with ace transportation...which is not the same as the one online). it was 70 plus tip. the service call you when the plane lands and tell you to call them when you get your luggage. we then waited about 15 minutes for the driver to pick us up. i'm not sure what the taxi's are like, but that option may be easier without the wait. we arranged for the car service in advance since we had 5 people and 5 suitcases...and it was nice having a large clean suv. the hotel also arranged for us to have ace shuttle us to pier 91 for 8 per person. we thought this would be the same type of service but it wasn't. this was an actual shuttle van that we shared with another family. when we checked out at 12:00 we were expecting it to be there waiting for us (due to our prior arrangement) but the front desk had to call and check on it. we probably waited about 15 minutes for them to show up...but the pier is close (2-3 miles) so not a big deal. due to all the intersections it took about 15-20 minutes to get there. the hyatt also has a free shuttle within a mile (to and from) of the hotel. they will come when you request it - be sure to tip if you use that service.other nice items: all staff were very friendly, walgreens is close-by for snacks and sodas and any forgotten items, monorail is close by, coin operated washer / dryer, free wifi, neighborhood has lots of small restaurants around.minor items that would be nice if they had (but they don't): more hooks in the bathroom to hang towels in so that you can more easily reuse them, a makeup mirror, a safe for locking up laptops, ipads, etc. (if you need a safe you have to go to the front desk).dear brenda s,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories and made the most of our amenities in our beautiful hotel and city. i will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will be so happy to know they made a difference. we are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. please let us know when you plan on retuning to seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!sincerely, sarah junge",loved hyatt house for our pre-cruise visit!

hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"i'm sure many people bill hyatt house downtown as a hip, penthouse style apt, where you can go out and see what makes seattle great, and it is. from my window on the 8th floor, you can overlook the space needle, museums below, giant artwork molds and the bustle of a city come alive with fun!for me though, it was all about winding down from a 13-week stint from my company, and meeting a friend, to start an adventure down the coast. i relished that i could bring up delicious sandwiches from the downstairs eatery, or go up on the rooftop and just hang out. i loved the view of the bay from my loft style suite, while reading a book. i liked curling up in their oh so comfy bed, with their plush pillows that were perfectly for resting and rejuvenating a weary soul.mostly, i loved the fact that i could just be. and i think that is the point of hyatt house. you make it what you want it. and its oh so easy to do that...dear sbtimetraveler,thank you very much for taking the time to write a review of our hotel and your stay here at the hyatt house seattle. we very much appreciate all the feedback we get. i am very happy to hear that you felt our hotels rooms were hip and what you were looking for, i am glad that you enjoyed the view of the space needle.these are the kind of reviews that we strive for. i hope the next time you are in the seattle area that you choose us again. we know you have a lot of choices. sincerely,jon",a place to wind down
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"across street from space needle so nice and clean and nice helpful people, easy to find and easy pick up transportation to pier, next to rail also we requested view and was great, nice hot breakfast alot to choose from,enjoyed ot soooo much glad we picked itlouis s,it was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the hyatt house seattle downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting. i will share your feedback with all of the team who has been consistently recognized as exceeding customer service standards. we appreciate the positive comments and will look forward to your future visits to seattle.sarah junge",so nice and grreat view
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,staff was very friendly and especially helpful. included breakfast was better than most hotel breakfasts. location is right at the foot of the space needle. public transportation (monorail and buses) were within a block of the hotel. the room had a refrigerator and microwave.,hyatt house
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"we had a great bed, a well equipped kitchen, sitting room with television that you could pivot to the bedroom. the shower was a great one for sure. the breakfast was very good with a chef who made omelets to order. the hotel is close to the space needle and park. parking was reasonable for a downtown hotel. the staff were very helpful.hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.mike h,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. we are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. please let us know when you plan on returning to seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!sarah junge",suite with everything
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"the location is great. it is across the street from the seattle center therefore the space needle, pacific science center, the armory, emp, museum of pop culture, artists playground, etc. are very easy to get to. the rooms are suites. it seems the ones facing the space needle (01-10) are more spacious or the layouts seems more spacious. i had family in a 19 room, which was a corner and it had the same features but a smaller table/island and living space. the suites are well supplied with everything you would need and the front desk is more than happy to give you extra supplies.the staff at this hotel is excellent. they are accommodating and very considerate. they call it a continental breakfast but i think it is significantly better than that. it has several hot food options, which change everyday and there is a always an omelet bar. in your room, there is a note with the rush hours for the free breakfast. it is pretty accurate. they also have a great happy hour and coffee is always available downstairs. for picky kids or late night eats or when the armory is already closed, there is a 24 hour drive thru mcdonalds.the only issue i had with the location was the parking garage. the spaces are tight. and you are assigned a space when you check in. the garage is underneath the hotel (which is convenient) but to drive in and out you have to use a special garage key. however, with the monorail across the street you probably do not need car.",perfect hotel for families and large groups
hyatt house seattle/downtown,3,"i would not recommend this hotel, the staff were not helpful, we had issues with our bills and the front desk said they could not adjust. the power went out in the room and maintenance could not fix it, got ready in the dark with no power.",not impressed
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"directly across space needle, chihuly and emp. loved the secured parking, worth the extra cost. would stay here again! everything was quick to access. the room itself was comfortable with a mini kitchen, and sitting area. having the tv rotate to either side of room was helpful. every staff member from front desk, maids, maintenancell were friendly and helpful. i felt safe and our stay was extremely comfortable. there is a mcdonald's across the street for those needing a quick bite, not a fan but it was nice to know it was there.only thing that could have oneimproved our stay was more time!",this is the one to stay at
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"hyatt house is right across the street from the space needle. if you are out walking you can always find you way back, the breakfast is very good and includes lots of selections for everyone. clean rooms and friendly staff members.",can't beat this location
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"hotel staff and service were great. perfect place to stay for families. rooms were especially roomy, clean, and well appointed. a relaxing place to stay. we were able to walk to all the tourist sites downtown. for us, it was important that we get our steps counted on our trackers we were able to walk to chinatown and pike's place market with ease.",seattle excellence
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"hotel had a great location (by space needle) for family vacation to seattle. room had two queen beds plus a pull out sofa, so our family of 4 could spread out a bit. good breakfast buffet included with room. room cleaning was poor as only one of the two beds was made and we received no clean towels or new shampoo.",good hotel for family trip
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"room ok ( we had queen suite) bathroom very small. restaurant poor. staff friendly and tried to please.hitel well suited for my needs as near the conference centre. hotel shuttle bus fabulous ,drives 1 mile radius around the hotel, so very convenient and easy to get to shops and restaurants.dear evelynk,thank you for taking time out of your to complete a tripadvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. i am glad to hear that you found our location to be great and our staff to be friendly! i greatly appreciate your 4 star review. if i can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. we appreciate your business! sincerely,jonathan",seattle
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,"i was very happy with this hotel. the location can't be beat. it is modern and very clean. i liked that there is a separate sitting area and a small kitchen. the free breakfast and free wifi was really good as well. staff was very nice and knowledgeable. my only gripe is the parking was 25 plus tax a night and the parking spaces are ridiculously small and tight. also they need to train their housekeeping staff on down free bedding. i asked for foam pillows since i was allergic to down and they just brought me more down pillows. i would definitely stay here again.thank you for completing a tripadvisor revoew regarding your recent stay at our hotel. please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. i greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. if i can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. we look forward to being of service to you in the near future. best regards, jonathan",great hotel and great location!

hyatt house seattle/downtown,2,"not pleased. poor experience. will definitely stay somewhere else next time. 7 day/6 night stay...zero cleaning despite numerous requests, no fresh towels or linens entire week other than towels/soap/toilet paper we helped ourselves to from nearby cart. overflowing garbage cans were finally put in hallway day 4.dear robinsu9085vk,thank you very much for taking the time our of your day to review our hotel and share your stay with us. i very much appreciate the feedback and i am very sorry to hear about the poor costumer service you experienced. i assure you that your feedback is taken seriously and we will use it to better our hotels operations. i am happy to hear that you enjoyed our great location. please keep us in mind the next time you are in the seattle area. we would love to be given another opportunity to ensure you have a great stay. please feel free to reach out to me personally. we do appreciate your business. sincerely,jonathan",great location. poor customer service.
hyatt house seattle/downtown,4,well we arrived in our taxi to be greeted by a very spacious clean looking modern hotel. the reception staff dealt with our needs efficiently and in a friendly manor and our rooms were large fresh and well presented. although the bar staff did and efficient job with drinks when placing food orders it took an absolute age to be served. we actually thought they had forgotten us they state onsite parking in their description but there is an extra charge for this when you arrive :-(. still the space needle is right outside and its close to many other attractions so would definitely recommend a stay.,first stop on our us tour
hyatt house seattle/downtown,5,"the hyatt house (not to be confused with the nearby hyatt place) is a new hotel right by the space needle and monorail. my room faced the monorail track, but surprisingly i really didn't hear it at all so i was impressed with the soundproofing. it wasn't perfect though as the room also faced a tv station garage whose warning chime every time it was opened did get through and could get annoying. the room set up i had was like a one bedroom apartment with a kitchenette that was stocked with cooking utensils, pots, pans, plates, silverware, etc and a separate bedroom with a door. bathroom had a large shower with the good water pressure (no tub). the free breakfast buffet was great with eggs, potatoes, a meat (sausage, bacon, or ham), and a variable dish (pancake, biscuit and sausage gravy). there were also fruit, yogurt, cereal, and toast options plus the omelette station (you might have to wait a while though depending on time). fitness room had a few treadmills, ellipticals, bicycles, dumbbells, a sort of universal, and towels. maybe a spray bottle and paper towels or wet wipes to wipe down handles and bench might have been nice. overall, i really liked the hotel and best of all it was reasonably priced -- less expensive than meeting-sponsored hotels near the convention center (about a mile away).masahiro k,thank you for choosing to stay at hyatt house during your recent trip to seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on tripadvisor. we value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.sarah junge",reasonably priced great hotel in seattle
