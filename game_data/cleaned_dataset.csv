call of duty: world at war,"once upon a time, call of duty was a legit, epic, ww2 shooter. there was a time where snipers camped and didn't run around quick scoping. there was a time where submachine gunners ran around and didn't camp in corners. there was a time where thermal scopes didn't exist and smokes actually did someting. there was a time where tanks roamed the battlefield and dominated over everyone. there was a time where 2-3 bullets actually killed you instead of 10-12. there was a time where shotguns weren't op. there was a time where 12 year olds didn't sleep with your mom. there was a time where squeakers didn't dominate over people. there was a time where trolls didn't anger over-sensitive people. all in a place called call of duty: world at war"

call of duty: world at war,"world at war is possibly the best ww2 style shooter alongside with red orchestra 2. you may love or hate the cod franchise, but there is no doubt this is a good game. don't let bad reputation of newer titles ruin previous games in the series."
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty: world at war, is the best call of duty to ever be made, and will ever be made. the perfect amount of flamethrower, and dedicated servers should keep you from playing any other call of duty. if i were to rate this game it would be a 9/10."
call of duty: world at war,"this game is genuinely the best call of duty game, and it's genuinely an incredible game. the campaign was really good, nazi zombies is a blast, even better with friends, and the multiplayer was really good back in the day. all in all, i'd recommend this to anyone. especially someone who loves wave-based survival games. nazi zombies is the best part about this game, and it is one hell of a time. :p"

call of duty: world at war,"when i was 10 years old i remember my dad getting me this game for christmas. i remember playing the campaign and enjoying it and being scared by the zombie mode that was unlocked upon finishing the game. during this time i didn't have internet so i couldn't play online. due to this i always played with my dad. i believe that lasted for a couple months and i begged my dad to get the internet set up so i could play with other people. call of duty: world at war was my first online game and it was a great experience. campaign: - i would say the campaign in this game is fairly average, but one of the best call of duty campaigns. - you can play all, but two missions cooperatively. multiplayer: - personally, i thought this game had the best multiplayer out of all the call of duty games. i loved playing hardcore headquarters, hardcore search and destroy, and war. - unfortunetly, this games feels basically dead these days and i don't really see a reason to play it. - on pc there is a problem where you get kicked from games for no reason by punk buster. zombies: - this game comes with four fun zombie maps upon purchase. - there are loads and loads of custom maps to play - four player coop. i honestly can't think of any negative things to say about this game. if you're looking for a game to play custom zombie maps this is the game for you!"
call of duty: world at war,my first and favorite cod. no hackers online. nazi zombies mods will have you hooked for hours!!
call of duty: world at war,the campaign on veteran was fun and challenging. custom zombies is great with friends as well.
call of duty: world at war,there are no microtransactions.
call of duty: world at war,"world at war is a masterpiece and a damn good game. the gameplay is simply cod4 with a different era. its fun, fast, and arcadie. in terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of wwii from both a russian and american perspective; battling the japanesse on iwo jima and beating down the 3rd reich from stalingrad to berlin. featuring the voice talents of keifer sutherland for the american sgt. roebuck, and gary oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails russian sniper - viktor reznov. the campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. the singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other 'call of duty' game. multiplayer is still alive and active. the servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. waw's multiplayer is very fun and solid. it may have a couple of cheap moments like any other cod has. but it is still very enjoyable and can keep you entertained for a couple of hours. as always i leave the best for last. zombies! call of duty: world at war's zombie mode is one of the best co-op experiences i have ever had. its fun, gameplay is solid, theres a story, and it will give you and your friends hours upon hours of entertainment. the game comes with 4 solid maps to play on. natch der untoten, verruckt, shi no numa, and der riese. these maps offer great variety and are very fun to play in. zombies is the biggest and most alive part of this game. with a community that has created thousands upon thousands of custom zombie maps that one can enjoy. many map makers like zct and tmg provide high quality maps that can be compared to treyarch's best. you still reading eh? go and buy this game now! yeah thats right, now! this is a game everyone should have in their libraries as it offers many hours of entertainment."
call of duty: world at war,is anyone else here just for zombies???
call of duty: world at war,"when infinity ward released call of duty 4: modern warfare back in 2007, the developer was met with critical acclaim and praise for breaking away from the world war ii setting that had started to bog down the once revolutionary series. that made treyarch's decision to bring the fifth installment back to the historical time period that much more confusing - why mess with success? well, call of duty: world at war returns to the series' roots, and is a good reminder of why world war ii games became so popular in the first place - the tone is gritty, the pace is frantic, and the action is visceral. world at war's story is split between two very different fronts - the ferocious jungle campaign of the pacific theatre, and the retaliatory invasion of the russians on the eastern front. that's right - no pesky normandy invasions this time around! in the pacific, you take on the role of private miller of the united states marine corps, and take part in the island hopping campaign towards okinawa. on the eastern front, you play as private dimitri petrenko, and are tasked with pushing the nazis out of russia and marching into berlin. the campaign is paced exceptionally well so that after a few missions of fighting as miller in the pacific, you'll switch over to play as dimitri in eastern europe. this stops the campaign from becoming stale, keeping it fresh and exciting. perhaps the best part of the campaign is the sheer amount of variety found in the missions. the first mission as private petrenko, for example, comes straight out of the movie enemy at the gates. narrowly surviving a massacre in nazi controlled stalingrad, you and an injured comrade have to make your way through the enemy filled streets armed with only a sniper rifle in order to assassinate the german general. in addition to sniper duels, you'll also have to burn out enemy fortifications during the campaign, as well as command a tank through enemy infested germany. one of the most memorable missions has you playing as neither miller nor petrenko, but petty officer locke, a gunner for a pby catalina flying boat. in addition to shooting down japanese patrol boats, merchant ships, and fighter planes, you'll have to try and rescue american sailors stranded in the sea after their fleet is decimated by a squadron of kamikaze fighters. the mission is really unique, and the intensity ramps up significantly as more japanese planes show up, and ammo starts becoming scarce. the first person views of the plane's interior as well as the exceptional dialogue make this mission much more than a standard rail shooting experience. although it is overall an invigorating experience, the campaign does have a few faults - most notably, some annoying glitches. for example, in order to finish one mission, you have to regroup with your squad. the mission won't end, however, until you backtrack half way through the level and unstick one of your ai buddies with a grenade - something that obviously shouldn't make into the finished product. there are a few other minor glitches as well, such as the little grenade symbol by your feet sometimes staying on screen long after its explosion, but these usually don't have an effect on the gameplay, and are thus easily ignorable. as great as the campaign is alone, it's even greater with a few friends. world at war allows you to play through the entire campaign with up to three friends, and you can even turn on competitive scoring, much like in halo 3, to add a new layer of depth when playing with friends. the other co-operative mode in world at war is the ever-addictive nazi zombies. with a few friends, you get to fight off a never-ending horde of nazi zombies, starting off with just a pistol. as the game continues, and the waves get progressively harder and harder, new guns are available to purchase. it's hectic and crazy, and although no left 4 dead, it is a heck of a lot of fun. if nazi zombies isn't your thing, then you might find world at war's multiplayer more enjoyable. treyarch took the super addictive multiplayer system from modern warfare, and it still is great. classes, perks, prestige classes - it's all here. of course, some of the technology present in call of duty 4 wasn't around back in the 1940's, so treyarch did have to make a few, slight changes. for example, instead of being able to call in helicopters after getting a killing streak, you can bring in attack dogs to attack your foes, or call in artillery strikes to bombard enemy positions. the essentials are all the same however. you get experience points for killing enemies and winning matches, which can be used to unlock new, powerful guns, weapon accessories and armor, and better perks. the prestige class returns as well, allowing you to return to level 1 after reaching the maximum level. you can do this up to 10 times, so if you are dedicated in getting to the top, be prepared to put a lot of hours in world at war. the graphics in world at war are stunning, with dazzling explosions lighting up the screen and individual character models looking impressively detailed, especially up close, such as when a banzai soldier jumps on you with a bayonet in your face. the animations are spectacular as well, with no two soldiers dying the same way. you can even blow off individual body parts off with certain weapons, like the shotgun, which is of course extremely satisfying. the game's audio also stands up extremely well. the game features big name voice talent such as kiefer sutherland and gary oldman, and the soundtrack is immersive and fitting. the guns sound realistic and appropriately powerful - you can even hear the sounds of sizzling flesh after burning enemies with the flamethrower. if that sound doesn't draw you into the war, i'm not sure if anything will. in the end, call of duty: world at war is a bit of an odd duck. it combines the new, successful multiplayer system of modern warfare with the old, familiar setting of world war ii. though wwii games are a dime a dozen, call of duty is still at the top for a reason. the campaign is varied and exciting, and can be played with up to three friends. the multiplayer is deep and addictive, and the new nazi zombie mode is surprisingly entertaining. the only major obstacle to enjoying this game for some is probably the setting. if you're absolutely sick of world war ii, then you might end up forcing yourself not to enjoy this game. however, if you're a fan of first person shooters in the least, then world at war will provide an enthralling experience."
call of duty: world at war,better than the cods coming out now
call of duty: world at war,good game and is not dead.
call of duty: world at war,"this game has held up suprisingly well. it was the last decent cod made, imo, and is well worth a playthrough by any shooter fan. great story, fun weapons, excellent sound design and great graphics, whats not to love?"
call of duty: world at war,"in my honest opinion, this remains to be the last great game in the call of duty series. the campaign holds up very well and is incredibly challenging on the highest difficulty. problem is, very few people play the multiplayer for this game these days, as far as i've seen... well worth the money if you can pick it up on sale."
call of duty: world at war,"1. this doesn't have a awful remix of beauty of annihilation. 2. no gimicks in zombies. 3. dedicated modded zombie community. 4. the best version of zombies you'll ever play. don't buy black ops 2.5, buy this. faq: do all maps come free? yes. dedicated servers? yes. can you teach me to play zombies? man, there are plenty of guides on the internet, but one thing i will tell you is that wall weapons are your friend, use them. oh and a side note, hey thanks for getting my review popular, but just because i have a popular review it doesn't mean you guys should just randomly add me. sorry, it's not that i don't like making friends, but i'd rather met people a better way than just that, thanks guys."
call of duty: world at war,"no drones, no high tech gadgets, no dlcs, no evil enemies with stupid reasons, only you and your rifle, fighting truly evil nazi and militarisim japs. very probably the last cod of wwii. one more thing, do you know what is better than killing nazi and zombies? killing nazi zombies!!!!!!!"
call of duty: world at war,"if you can pick it up during a sale, its definitely worth it just for zombies alone. the campaign is decent, but the last mission (veteran difficulty) is rediculous, how did the german army lose if they had that many grenades? modding is keeping this game alive ever since its release back in 2008, my personal favourites is the zombie pirate ship and some of the epic cod 4 mods for waw."
call of duty: world at war,havent played much of this game but yeah its cool
call of duty: world at war,"custom zombies is an endless ammount of fun. amazing maps, great community, great zombie killing. rip yote."
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty: world at war is by far one of the best fps co-op games on steam. why? not only does it have an entertaining fast paced still active multiplayer and an extremely involved campaign, but world at war also comes with modding capabilities. many waw fans agree, one of the best parts of call of duty is its zombies! within the zombie mode, modders and mappers have introduced custom zombies maps for you to download online. this way you aren't stuck playing the same 4 zombie maps. there are hundreds of custom maps featuring customized weapons, camos, perks, scenery, storylines, objectives, game modes, and much more! would definitely recommend this game to any fps zombie lover out there. a+ in my book! download custom zombies maps here:"
call of duty: world at war,pros - not set in space - no boost jumping - no exo suits - no micro-transactions - no 12 year old squekers or ali-a fanboys screaming down the mic - all dlc is included with the game for free - custom zombie maps - the campaign is awesome - 64 player servers - you can drive tanks for ♥♥♥♥s sake - still fun to play after being released 8 years ago cons - made by the same company who made black ops 3 - martyrdom and last stand perks
call of duty: world at war,"the second best call of duty ever made and one of the last good remaining ones. call of duty: world at war is not a masterpiece but it is a damn good game. the gameplay is simply cod4 with a different era. its fun, fast, and arcadie. the single player is alright with a couple of interesting characters. nothing worth praising here but a lot of enjoyment is to be had from the campaing. multiplayer is still alive and active. the servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. waw's multiplayer is very fun and solid. it may have a couple of cheap moments like any other cod has. but it is still very enjoyable and can keep you entertained for a couple of hours. as always i leave the best for last. zombies! call of duty: world at war's zombie mode is one of the best co-op experiences i have ever had. its fun, gameplay is solid, theres a story, and it will give you and your friends hours upon hours of entertainment. the game comes with 4 solid maps to play on. natch der untoten, verruckt, shi no numa, and der riese. these maps offer great variety and are very fun to play in. zombies is the biggest and most alive part of this game. with a community that has created thousands upon thousands of custom zombie maps that one can enjoy. many map makers like zct and tmg provide high quality maps that can be compared to treyarch's best. you still reading eh? go and buy this game now! yeah thats right, now! this is a game everyone should have in their libraries as it offers many hours of entertainment. like stated before this is the 2nd best call of duty to be made. i give this game a 9.5/10 as it truly deserves that score."
call of duty: world at war,they need to remaster this
call of duty: world at war,its not infinite warfare
call of duty: world at war,"buy the damn game. whether it be the endless and challenging multiplayer, the zombies, the tens of thousands of mods, or the fact that it's my favorite cod game out there. buy. the. damn. game."
call of duty: world at war,best cod on pc along with cod 4 + all dlc free +custom zombies +mods +great campaign +zombies -multiplayer isn't at its peak -you will run into hackers in multiplayer
call of duty: world at war,"i have a story to tell, might get nostalgic to some of you so sit down and grab a drink. back in 2009, i was at my cousins house playing out in the yard, then his bigger brother left his room to go walking with the older cousins, leaving just me, my cousin(we'll call cathal) and my other cousin aaron. now we went in his room and found his xbox 360 and a so we turned it on. the game inside, call of duty: world at war. we decided to play and when we got on, we choose multiplayer and played with the split screen mode ond choose one of my favourite maps, castle. we would camp at the two main buildings snipping with the ptrs-41 and using the other pre-made classes. after we played for a few hours, his brother came back and we left to go back outside. i went home asking my dad if i can get this game call call of duty. he said sure. ever since that day, my life was consumed by first person shooters. i got it for the wii btw. each day i would go onto my wii and play waw. then i got an xbox 360 and xbox live. thats when i met people from around ireland or the uk (i live in australia now). i would play multiplayer for hours, zombies for hours, replay that mission where istill will never figure out how to shot amirch hamsel with a pistol from that range like wtf. tehn i got the mw series, black ops which i loved just as much and halo games which came with the 360. now, 7 years later, im 16. i play counter strike and other games on my 360. however, every so often, ill boot up waw, mw, bo, to relive distant memories. remembering all my friends who i would add to platy cod with, friends who i miss so much, friends who ill never talk to again. but in the end, call of duty is an old classic you boot up on a saturday evening to play with friends, have a laugh to escape life drama. ill miss the old days, split screening, the ppsh-41, the sense of the japense charging with a banzai. the fall of that german soilder on top of the reighstag, the sense of sniping 7 soilders and a dog with 5 bullets. ill miss cod back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. i love this game 10/10 :')"
call of duty: world at war,remember when cod was good? no? well here it is.
call of duty: world at war,"i almost hesitated buying it because negative reviews, but i went ahead: &gt; i bought the game for $10 dollars on summer 2016 sale &gt; i downloaded the 8.12 gb game &gt; i opened 'world at war multiplayer', refreshed list, and.... &gt;&gt; holy crap, servers. i join and there are still people playing&lt;&lt; &gt; i play a few games and i wonder if there zombies &gt; you must go to singleplayer/co-op to play zombies &gt; i see zombies in singleplayer but what about multiplayer zombies? &gt;&gt; in co-op, there a list of servers for co-op story and zombies -- i didn't even have to install any patch or modify my game in any way-- and i almost didn't buy the game. negative reviewers, you lied to me."
call of duty: world at war,"the last true cod experience for pc gamers. dedicated servers, custom maps, modding, all that you need!"
call of duty: world at war,this was the last call of duty that actually meant 'call of duty'
call of duty: world at war,this was the first cod game i ever played and it will always be my personal favorite. :) 9/10
call of duty: world at war,not one kid has claimed to 'bang my mom'.
call of duty: world at war,"welcome to my review for call of duty world at war. overview: call of duty world at war is a great call of duty game and extremly fun. while everyone says its a copy and paste of cod 4 its a good one and i'm glad treyarch made a ww2 version of cod 4 because the ww2 cods were great. if your wondering where all the dlc is its included in the game and its a good price for the base game and all 4 map packs. campaign: the campaign is really cool and it proves the struggle that the russians had during the germans rise to power. its one of those games that are so gorey that it makes you grateful that you didnt have to go to war and it makes you apreciate the army's work, for example you shoot someone in the arm and it will fly off and blood will splatter everywhere, shoot someone in the head with a shotgun and the enemys head will fly off, shoot someone in the leg and both legs will fly off. the story is great, you play as 2 different characters in the campaign: dimitri petrenko (russian) &amp; private c miller, on the american side you play as private c miller and you escape torture and raid the japanese camp that you escape from and continue to fight the war. it leads you through a long war that will keep you going for ages. for example on mission 2 theres an easter egg that lets you have a ray gun and mission 3 you get a flamethrower and another badass american mission is when you play as a commander on a ww2 plane and you feel like your raining death (a bit like death from above from cod 4, as i said this is a ww2 version of cod 4). the russian side where you play as dimitri is probably the best part of the campaign because it has the more badass missions. you start off by being in the middle of a massacre at a town square only to meet sergeant reznov who helps you avange the massacre. you continue the campaign trying to regain control of the reichstag (end 2 missions of the campaign) but through that journey you murder as many germans as you can, you even go to their homeland and murder them there. theres also a russian mission where you drive a tank as means of transport. the ending of the russian campaign (end of campaign acctually) is badass and im not going to spoil it, just youtube it or play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. overall i think the campaign is great and worth the price inculded in the game, i rate is 8/10 multiplayer: i dont really play much of this, probably a quarter of my hours but i stopped playing because of how many hackers are in multiplayer. just like cod 4 you have 5 create-a-class slots with a primary weapon and 1 attachment, a secondary weapon, an equipment slot, 3 perk slots and a vehicle slot (yes some maps you can drive a tank). there is a great gamemode called war where theres a flag you have to capture and the more kills you get the faster you can capture a flag, im not going into to much detail because thats pretty much all war is. the maps are surprisingly really fun and i really enjoy them. overall i give the multiplayer 7/10 because of the hackers, if there wasnt hackers i would give 8/10 zombies: this is probably my most played part and it is because of custom zombies. custom zombies is really fun and the people out there create some amazing maps maybe even better than treyarchs default map. i wouldn't suggest playing co-op zombies unless your playing with a friend because people will steal your window and you get people on the mic but if you play solo or with a friend you save yourself from the migraines. the 4 default zombies maps are included (nacht der toten, verruckt, shi no numa &amp; der reise) and they has some really nice features (shame that only der reise has pack a punch). there are 4 perks in zombies to which is very obvious (quick revive, speedcola, juggernog and double tap). quick revive is a self revive on solo which means when you down you can get back up but you only have 3 uses, juggernog increases your health from 2 hits to die to 4-5 hits to die, speedcola makes you reload double fast and double tap lets you shoot 2x as fast. the guns are good but not amazing unless you have the ray gun or unless your on der reise and can pack a punch (pack a punch gives you a cool camo and shooting sound and doubles, qtriples or quadruples your gun damage, not sure which). overall i think zombies is the best part, i wouldn't mind paying £20 for the zombies on its own but i rate the zombies part 9.5/10. one last note: if anyone does buy the game or enjoyed the review please thumbs up as this is the first review i have spent very long on but if you do get the game please send me a friend request, i'm always looking for friends on zombies but anyways buy the game and i promise you will love it. thanks for reading ;)"
call of duty: world at war,taught me more about world war 2 than my teacher
call of duty: world at war,"zombies, that is all."
call of duty: world at war,one of the wierdest and most fun fps games ever! some people call it hat simulator and i can see why there are tons of hats from strange hats to unusual hats this game is all about hats!
call of duty: world at war,this game is: 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain and 100% reason to purchase this game
call of duty: world at war,still standing in one of the best games in my collection. this is the bbest cod. *update* i have recently stopped playing as much. stop spamming me with friend requests :p
call of duty: world at war,"i have a deep hatred of call of duty (for a wide array of reasons), but this game on the pc kind of passed my firewall. in terms of system requirements and gameplay fluency, i was beyond surprised with how well this game runs. i was running a full 60 fps flawless, even on the higher-paced zombies mod, which honestly is the only saving grace in call of duty. the singleplayer was pretty interesting, too; it was a cool campaign of wwii taking place on two fronts against two highly different enemies - the japanese favor unconventional, barbaric and suicidal attacks which provide challenge for the close-quarters-oriented united states marines, and hitler's angels go against the soviets in a longer-ranged conflict. the weaponry feels so unique and abstract from other installments of this otherwise putrid franchise, though that primarily comes from the gore effects in this game. watching enemies' limbs go flying off when i blast them off with a pump-action shotgun reminds me of many years ago when i played this game on the xbox 360. so world at war provides an entertaining singleplayer, which also has the equivalent of halo's 'skulls' (difficulty and game modifiers that provide either more challenging or easier effects in the gameplay) and cooperative campaign gameplay (it did on the xbox, at least; i'm almost positive it does on the pc), and the zombies mode is at its strongest and purest roots. it's tragic when the series' (zombies) origins are the best version of it. oh, and it's world war ii, not this futuristic titanfall wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (one of my many reasons for loathing cod.)"
call of duty: world at war,i like the fact that this call of duty had guns and your boots were on ground
call of duty: world at war,the best call of duty +20 $ check +zombie check +custom map check +no ♥♥♥♥ing 70 $ dlc check +modding check +no 8 year old kid check -hacker uncheck

call of duty: world at war,zombies. zombies. zombies! zombies!!! that is all.
call of duty: world at war,"one of the best cods. great soundtrack, and the last cod with a cool ww2 feel. the multiplayer feels odd compared to other cod games, but isn't bad. also the cod that introduced the zombie mode, this game did it best."
call of duty: world at war,"my call of duty: world at war pros/cons list pros: +great campaign +fun multiplayer +modded zombies +not futuristic +great soundtrack +drivable tanks in multiplayer +well designed maps +one of the better cods cons: -killstreaks are annoying on some maps/gamemodes -weapons aren't balanced very well, i'm looking at you mp40 -perks like martyrdom -most people play tdm only -some maps are too gloomy looking for my taste conclusion: even though it shows its age at times, it's a great buy! thanks for reading my review :d"
call of duty: world at war,"amazing! better than new gen (bo3,aw,ghosts)"
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty: world at war is the fifth game in the cod franchise, releasing in 2008 on pc, ps3, ps2, wii and xbox 360. the game was developed by treyarch and published by activision. this game is set in the world war ii era where you play as various soldiers from united states and the red army. please note that this review is purely based on the single player aspect of world at war. the gameplay shares several features with the rest of the cod franchise up to this release. you spend the majority of the time with at least one other ai controlled squad member which guide you through levels and keeps you up to date with your current objective. you may only carry two weapons at any one time, whilst also having access to smoke grenades, molotov’s and hand grenades. we have all of the standard fps mechanics like crouching and prone positions. you recover health by staying out of line of fire of enemies, since there is no “health” packs throughout the game. you know when you are getting close to death as the edges of your screen glow red and your heartbeat increases. i personally think this is a nice feature rather than relying on a health bar, it adds to the immersion of the gameplay as the ui is very minimal. since this game was released almost eight years ago, the graphics are certainly starting to show their age, with some really low res textures, but the environments are all still really nicely designed, animations on everything is stellar too. character models are all high quality too. the game’s sound effects are brilliant too; you really feel like you are under heavy fire from enemies when you have surround sound on with a sub. the fully voice acted characters are also very well done too. this is one of the few cod games which i had a few moments of difficulty throughout the campaign. usually with cod games your ai partners are able to carry you through most levels with little interaction from you needed, however this game is different. the tank missions are the ones i found to be the most difficult as you really need eyes in the back of your head in order to avoid taking damage from the hundreds of enemies that have you in their sights. i am not condemning the game for difficulty; it is really refreshing to see a cod game has the challenge in it. the more recent cod games have become a walk in the park so it was nice to see something different here. whilst the game is linear, there are a few collectables to find throughout the single player campaign, there are 13 “death cards” to be found on every level which unlock cheat modes when playing in co-op. this again is a really cool feature and gives you some incentive to check every room, nook and cranny to find the collectables rather than a pointless achievement. the only negative point about this game for me is the game’s length. i realise i only played the single player so i am only getting half of the experience, but i would have liked to have seen at least five hour single player campaign mode. i managed to complete the game on a medium difficulty in just over three hours. you could replay the game to go back and find all of the collectables and you could also ramp up the difficulty, but given the linearity of the game i don’t see myself jumping into doing that anytime soon. looking at the steam chart numbers, the multiplayer scene is really active still so if multiplayer is your jam you will find a match quite easily still. technically i only had one issue, and that is with the graphics on some levels. it almost felt like my graphics card was dying as there was spewing graphics all over my screen at some point. it is hard to explain how they looked, but they were really off putting to the game and only happened every few levels. a simple re-load resolved the issue thankfully. call of duty: world at war is one of the best games in the cod franchise and one that still holds its own in the current generation of games. due to the single player’s length, the price point on this game is quite high at £19,99. i would say that if you plan on getting into the multiplayer side of this game, you should pick it up for that price, however if you are only interested in the single player campaign mode, you would be better off waiting for it to go on sale, unfortunately reduction on cod games are very rare so you need to keep your eyes peeled for the deals! for anyone who has just skipped a head to my rating; i will repeat, this game was reviewed purely on the single player campaign; please bear that in mind with this rating. tom's score card 1) stay away 2) not recommended 3) only recommended when on sale 4) recommended 5) highly recommended 6) this is a must play if you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up. if you would also like to follow my reviews more easily, be sure to join my group by clicking here . you may also be interested in checking out a pc gaming podcast, be sure to head here."
call of duty: world at war,2008 a year where exo suits where unheard of ahhh such a good year
call of duty: world at war,cod need to make more ww2 games! not like infinite warshit﻿... back when germans didn't scream ´´allahu akbar´´! #makecodgreatagain
call of duty: world at war,only bought this for custom zombies
call of duty: world at war,wait i don't have to rebuy all the dlc and the community is not dead? cool more nazi zombies for me. lorenzo is a filthy console peasant who won't play his favorite game on steam. console score: 9/10 pc score: 9.5/10
call of duty: world at war,best call of duty game
call of duty: world at war,do you like zombies? yes! do you like guns? yes! do you like cod? no! well this cod is fun for once!
call of duty: world at war,custom nazi zombies......................... i rest my case..
call of duty: world at war,"first buy on steam, (new pc gamer here, converted from console) and the pc version is like a totally different game from the console's. 60+ fps &amp; 1080p on extra graphics w/8x aa custom zombie maps easy server joining modding $20 only"
call of duty: world at war,you can fight dead nazis at taco bell and mcdonalds with chicken nugget blasters
call of duty: world at war,"custom zombies kept this game going! update: bo3 mod tools are out, custom zombies on waw has stalled."
call of duty: world at war,pros -10/10 -10/10 -10/10 -10/10 cons its too good
call of duty: world at war,"usually i try and avoid cod games like the plague but something about a wwii setting seemed like it could be interesting. after reading some reviews and watching some videos etc. i decided to get it and hell was it worth it. the campaign is short but a blast. you still are a badass but atleast you have to take cover and i ended up dying a ton of times on regular difficulty. the mulitplayer has a surprisingly decent amount of players playing it and on the right servers you will always be able to find a game and boy is it fun. zombies is also very fun and i would reccomend getting it with your friends for a real good time, because usually you'll have to wait awhile to find a zombie match. just all together this game ( atleast the campaign, and dont get me started on how amazing the seige on berlin is ) actually feels like a war and is a really good fps. i would definitely reccomend it to anyone that doesn't like future themed crummy games, or who is looking for a damn good fps."
call of duty: world at war,campaign is 10/10 multiplayer is 'good luck finding a normal game' zombies is 'do you wanna play custom zombies spongebob map' 42/0
call of duty: world at war,"in my books this is the best cod ever made. i love the atmosphere the game has: music, the way the graphics were made, the ruthless feel this game brings about war. brings back so many good memories from the years gone by. pretty sad its dead. nostalgia at its best."
call of duty: world at war,"this game is amazing, if u like world war 2 games, this one is as good as it gets, and the custom zombies is amazing."
call of duty: world at war,this is an awesome game it may not be new but every day there's new custom zombies maps even with a crappie pc this game works (trust me) its the only cod that you can play campain co-op this is awesome and hope you enjoy!!!
call of duty: world at war,admit it; you're buying this game specifically to play modded zombie maps.
call of duty: world at war,"hmm... where to begin with this amazing game. this game is the best call of duty game there is, in my opinion this game even tops cod4. let me explain why, the campaign is so much fun, intresting and replayable because this campaign has so many great missions. next the multiplayer... to date the multiplayer is amazing but nowadays there are a few hackers who just ruin it, but its very little that i see them in a game and there are some higher xp lobbies which will get you ranked up quickly if you are new to the game so you can get the good guns such as the mp-40, thompson and my fav weapon in the game the springfield plus the mp maps are just amazing and have been remade becuase they where just to great. and then there is zombies a gamemode that was nearly canceled (which would have been a massive mistake) the zombies maps are my favs out of the treyarch games and are the most fun to play and with people making modded zombie maps the fun can keep going. but zombies is very very fun if you have not played a cod treyarch game then i reccomend this one first to see how amazing cod really was. thanks for reading :)"
call of duty: world at war,"'i've seen things that no training can prepare you for, that i know of. i look at the faces around me, and i know that nobody expected anything like this.'"
call of duty: world at war,"this is one of the good call of duty games. based on cod4's iw3 engine, plus the modding capabilities, the community is developing the game's modding even fruther ahead. but the only things is - i can only see alot of custom zombie maps, speaking of mods and custom content. dear modders! if you're reading this review, please, make some cool multiplayer mods + some custom co-op campaign maps ^.^"
call of duty: world at war,custom zombies is pretty fun
call of duty: world at war,remember when call of duty was good? yeah this was it.
call of duty: world at war,"introduction: call of duty world at war developed by treyarch is now a beloved classic in the eye's of many call of duty enthusiasts and still incredibly sought after by pc gamers to this day. overview: developed by treyarch call of duty world at war remains amongst the top of many pc call of duty fans wishlists and standard playlists years after release for many reasons. true to the series fluid arcade style fps gameplay elements fueled by adrenaline and a constant gameplay flow. call of duty: world at war separates itself from the pack as the last true call of duty pc release. with graphics optimization unheard of in this day and age of cod console ports to a modding friendly pc release, whether it be it's first forray in into treyarchs now trademark zombie mode or a multitude of community driven content in all aspects of multiplayer. call of duty: world at war is seen as the last title in the series to be given the full pc treatment gamers grew used to and has sadly never returned. fans of the series who have never experienced call of duty: world at war will be amazed at the amount of content available as a standard retail release. the pc steam version of this title comes preloaded with the dlc preinstalled for $19.99 which, is why this title has never seen a price drop aside from activisions penchant for never letting their financial steely grip on price reductions slip through their fingers and benefit the consumer on the backend. i must reiterate this call of duty release simply doesn't need one. with all the content available in this iteration anyone considering a purchase will be more than pleased with their decision to opt in to the lesser known older brother of the black ops series. graphics: 8.5 just as any other version of the generation 7 call of duty games this is also based on the 2007 unreal engine which, means considering the amount of graphics optimization available call of duty: world at war in comparison to it's younger siblings still holds it's own in many aspects and more in some cases. gameplay: 8.0 although not quite as intricate as infinity wards fan favorite call of duty 4: modern warfare. world at war holds it's own where it matters.....solid gameplay. this is a tried and true call of duty recipe since the originals release which i am happy to say is represented perfectly. although a bit on the no frills side in comparison to modern warfare, some prefer it's tenacious gun battles and old school fps precision beats killstreak style and should in the least be embraced by all 'new school' call of duty fans. sound: 8.5 a series staple. call of duty doesn't let down even by current generation 8 standards. every whizzing bullet and explosion will test even the most high end of dolby surroud sound systems subwoofers currently on the market today. when the settings are placed just right, you can close your eyes and imagine what an existance in this chaotic time in history would have been like. this truley helps set the tone in any true battlefield experience and world at war doesn't dissapoint. online experience: 9.0 after all these years call of duty: world at war still has a thriving online vs. multiplayer community supplimented by a vast zombies experience that many consider to be superior to the franchises later releases. due solely to the dedicated modding community that activision has sadly all but forgotten about in it's later releases. with that being said the multiplayer servers are also maintained by groups of dedicated fps communities. one specific group that must be mentioned for it's servers integrity and organization is the [pde] ' perfectdarkelite', this groups primary servers are maintained by some of the most friendly and integrity driven individuals that i can proudly say i have played along side for countless hours of intense online battles. story: 7.5 the story of call of duty: world at war is what i would consider it's weakest point. seeded in the standard world war ii scenario, you won't find much originality here. yet with that being said it still manages to keep your interest as any call of duty action fest should with the series standard over exaggerated explosions and barely made it through situations, world at war still has it moments of surprize and awe. replay value: 10 with all the above mentioned features preinstalled in the retail release and available from the online community this is where call of duty: world at war shines above the rest!!! if your looking to make a call of duty purchase that will last into future if the past is any example then world at war is it! with a lower price tag than it's younger brothers, every dollar is a dollar well spent. the replay value of this title is endless. final review score: 8.0 there are two defining call of duty titles from the seventh generation that not only set the standard for all titles to come in the series but, also simply couldn't be matched in terms of gripping single player campaigns to this day call of duty 4: modern warfare and world at war. without a doubt call of duty 4: modern warfare is the superior of the two but, regardless there's a reason that treyarch continued to base multiple entries on the gameplay formula represented here....simply put because it's good and they knew it. if you are looking for one of the best world war ii campaigns in gaming history and an online experience that still bustles today, then look no farther."
call of duty: world at war,"probably one of the better call of duty games. still has an active multiplayer community. definitely worth buying, especially because what used to be dlcs are included in the deal."
call of duty: world at war,"still my favourite call of duty title to date. (owned on ps3, x360, wii, pc) seven years on and im still quoting game dialogue in normal conversations."
call of duty: world at war,better graphics than infinite warfare
call of duty: world at war,back when call of duty was good.
call of duty: world at war,single player? pretty smart. multiplayer? pretty ♥♥♥♥in' smart. zombies with the ability to play thousands of different custom ma- fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccckkkkkkkkinnnnggggg *breaths in* geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuuuuuuuuuuuussss. 9/10 zombies is like skyrim with guns. actually 8.5/10 unplayable.
call of duty: world at war,"this is a great game, almost no flaws with very good graphics for a 2008 game. i highly recommend this game for everything it has, multiplayer, campaign and zombies! custom maps are good too! you just need to find the right place to look! awesome game, treyach!"
call of duty: world at war,custom zombies makes this one of the best games on the steam store
call of duty: world at war,"let's be real, if you're buying this game today it's only for the zombies (and the very fun campaign!). sure the multiplayer is still there but it's a giant f&amp;#$fest which is only fun for a little bit before it get's old. the zombies mode, and more importantly, the modded zombies maps are what make this game. if you go on the steam waw forums you'll always manage to find people to play with if you don't already have friends to play it with. the custom made maps range from being absolutely horrifying to extremely comedic. there are probably hundreds if not thousands of maps online that you can download and play on (look up a tutorial on how to download them if you aren't sure). this leads to pretty much infinite entertainment. i'd definetly pick this game up, but if you're not sure, just look up modded waw zombies videos on youtube and see if you like them! btw i see people complaining that newer cod games don't have co-op campaign but the reason they don't have it is obvious - the new campaigns are so bad it'd be a waste of time and money to implement co-op campaign since nobody would want to play it."
call of duty: world at war,"i bought this game for one reason only ... custom zombies! first off, you'll never get bored of zombies as there are so much maps to pick from (there are websites with hundreds of maps).. literally it's endless.if you can get a few friends to buy it too and get all the same maps, it is just endless hours of fun. however i didn't think much of the multiplayer side of this game as i expected it to be like the console - full of hackers and no one playing. wow i was wrong! i went in to expect no one online. pressed refresh and hunders of severs and i had the option to filter it and only show servers that aren't modded. i even saw a few servers full of 40+ people playing! (yep! 40+ people playing in the one match of tdm and on the tiny maps-- it's just chaos in a good way). seriously, buy this game for campaign, multiplayer and zombies! worth all of your money and all of your hours! really fun and addictive. this is the game where call of duty was at it's best and if it wants to return to that, just remaster this f***ing game! a must buy! &lt;3"
call of duty: world at war,custom maps. that is all.
call of duty: world at war,got banned by admin kid cause i had 10 killstreak. 10/10 nobody called my mom a ♥♥♥♥♥ in this one
call of duty: world at war,better than infinite warfare.
call of duty: world at war,"pros: + 2 different ww2 fronts + variety of weapons and scenarios + co-op campaign + zombie modes + mod support + still strong playerbase cons: - occasional graphical bugs &amp; glitches - ai issues in certain places - some problems with connecting to other players - meeting hackers comment: this game is fantastic. no need to build up tension when a game this good is reviewed. by no means is it a perfect game but surely a very good ww2 fps worth taking a look at. people who love ww2 shooters and war stories will get their fair share of epic scenes and combat. the variety is what shines, the fact that the missions don't get repetitive. this is thanks to 2 main campaign paths, one in the pacific and the other in europe (east front). yes, we have seen some scenarios in previous cod or moh games. but it matters little because it takes a different take on these which keeps it fresh. it has some flaws, like ai being weird in a couple of places, or the occasional glitch. but overall the campaign is great and what makes it even better is the co-op option. that being said it is not always easy to connect to your friends. same can be said for multiplayer in general but even though the game is old the playerbase remains quite steady. this might be partially because this is (so far) the last ww2 cod game and mod support was still a thing here. to top off the posibilities this is the first time we get zombie modes in cod. and it's glorious, especially custom zombies. playing these modes with friends is loads of fun! i recommend this game and i advise you to get some mods after you finish with the base experience. p.s.: ignore the play time, i played a ton of this back in the day but i don't own a cd/dvd drive anymore so i bought it again on steam to try it out"
call of duty: world at war,saw private gabe in the war-field. wanted to ask him where is gaben and he died in front of me and i laughed. gaben/10. best dying simulator ever.
call of duty: world at war,"face it no one really gets this game for the multiplayer, it's all for the custom zombies truly powerful review"
call of duty: world at war,"good community, fun multiplayer, awesome zombies and cool custom maps. 9/10 would bang"
call of duty: world at war,"damn good game ------------------------- theres two reasons why your here 1 your childhood 2 zombies --------------------------------- i love this game, not only is the campaign excellent but the zombies are very addicting to play but the core gameplay is so good ------------------- but the main reason you should buy this game is just how fun it is to play with friends. ---------------------------------- lastly its a very fair price for the content it has and if i can run it then you should to."
call of duty: world at war,"they should create more cods like this one, not like black ops 3, infinite warfare. that robots thing, technology, all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."
call of duty: world at war,"this game is definitely worth the $20. filled with action, a great campaign and good multiplayer, it's a great buy. although the amount of hackers in this game is quite irritating, especially when you come across one in matchmaking, it's easy to see past it."
call of duty: world at war,"heads up, ♥♥♥ down. prepare for the best game ever. this game is truely one of the best games and probably the best call of duty game too. it has everything! ( i have probably over 200 hours on xbox ) you can either go in to multiplayer with 64 players and re-act world war 2 or you could jump in to zombie survival with over 9000 maps ( seriously ) or you could play a awesome campaign about fighting against the germans and imperial army while being either a american or a russian. and yes! it's a bit old now, but who cares!? it's still one of the best games out there. go get it gurl, you won't regret it!"
call of duty: world at war,"i only have 9 hours on pc but i have 1000s on console, this was probably and is the best call of duty i've ever played, multiplayer was amazing but it spawned the game mode 'zombies' that we know and love today, every time would get home from school all i wanted to do was play zombies and kick ♥♥♥ with friends. it helped me through so much ♥♥♥♥ in life and it kept my mind off things that were giving me problems at the time. i really hope they remake this game because in my eyes, it was and still is perfect."
call of duty: world at war,top notch.
call of duty: world at war,"the campaign is a classic, the multiplayer is addicting and fun, and the modded zombies is priceless. 10/10 one of the best games i ever played"
call of duty: world at war,"bought it for nostalgia, you mother ♥♥♥♥ers."
call of duty: world at war,ok so when i first played this game it was just a new call of duty game. but as i get to play it now on my pc i now know to true glory of this game and leared to love it. beast call of duty game ever!
call of duty: world at war,"this game has the best campaign in any of the games in it's franchise, i mean 4 player co-op campaing whats not to like?"

call of duty: world at war,if i got this game for $60 i wouldn't even be mad. the campaign is worth it. very fun and the gore is a huge plus. treyarch did an awesome job with this game. unfortunately multiplayer servers are down. but campaign is loads of fun. love the gritty feeling of this game.
call of duty: world at war,"if you know how to intall a mod, this game can have a lifetime's worth of play time."
call of duty: world at war,the campaign is a lot of fun. but it's also so brutal and so violent that it makes you think. call of duty is good. just not good enough to be bought again and again every year. but world at war is definitely worth a purchase in my book.
call of duty: world at war,"buy this game. thats it, it is amazing"
call of duty: world at war,"the last cod to be set during wwii; also, the best one. good ol' times of call of duty. if you've got some spare bucks, spend them on this game, you will not regret it. pros: - online multiplayer still heavily populated after all these years; - neat campaign (pvt. petrenko rules); - nazi zombies :) cons: - as a historian, i'm stubborn as to accept weapons not being faction-locked (in online multiplayer, you have every weapon at your disposal, according to your level, but meh, many games are like that)."
call of duty: world at war,"excellent campaign, zombies &amp; mulitplayer that actually works! what's not to love? :d"
call of duty: world at war,"once upon a time, there was a call of duty game that, much like the others, recieved hate for being part of the cod francise. however, it had many great things that people consider groundbreaking in newer cods such as gore and interactive map elements (in the form of tanks). once upon a time, that game wasn't infested by hackers in multplayer. that game was call of duty world at war. a fantastic ww2 game that was on par with brothers in arms for showing how dark ww2 (or any war for that matter) was/can be. we had access to many weapons of devestation, from m1a1 bazookas, to m2-2 flamethrowers, and other feared weapons such as the mg42, or as many soldiers dubbed it, 'hitler's buzzsaw.' explosives and large calibre ammunition showed their true power when they ripped apart characters limb by limb, the flamethrower engulfed and charred the bodies of soldiers in true awe. but the experience doesn't just end with a heroic end to a dark and gritty campaign and 80+levels of multiplayer, oh no, for an extra, small map had made it into the game; nacht der untoten, night of the living dead. in a move that caught everyone, even many of the employees at treyarch, offguard, an extra mode was added into call of duty that would be immortalized as a icon of the series. nazi zombies. many players, myself included, spent countless hours having fun with this little surprise. and it didn't end there; more maps were added, and all treyarch games since have had it included, as if the modding community wasn't putting out enough maps as it was. but its time was cut short when modern warfare 2 came out the next year and as the fanbase moved on, the hackers moved in, polluting the public multiplayer lobbies like a cancer, making people less inclined to play the game. and so ends the story of call of duty world at war... or does it? no, the game won't die for a long time because of its dedicated custom map making community, creating more and more great zombies experiences each day."
call of duty: world at war,just buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game cuz its amazing
call of duty: world at war,"one of the few call of duty games actually worth your money and time. world at war is quite possibly the best cod of all time. it takes place in the second wolrd war and lets you play as not only the american marines fighting in japan, but the soviets fighting in germany. from what i've seen, people still play multiplayer. you also get the 3 zombie map dlcs with this purchase so that is a plus. if you enjoy shooters and are a history lover, this game is perfect."
call of duty: world at war,i'm only writing this so i can get a badge edit: some dude told me that i should write 'useful reviews' and 'contribute something helpful' so: its a pretty good game
call of duty: world at war,extremely sexy
call of duty: world at war,"arguably the best of the franchise and well populated. brilliantly nostalgic and still an absolute joy to play. punkbuster can be a problem however. 'call of duty' was and remains a franchise at the forefront of the online fps genre. dominating both console and pc alike, it's rivaled some would say, only by it's ea counterpart 'battlefield'; but 'world at war' was something else. released in 2008 it adapted and built perfectly on the foundations set the previous year by activision's installment in the series - 'modern warfare'. trearch's addition gave us features the likes of which we'd never seen in 'call of duty 4'. vehicles. tanks. though on face value a simple addtion, their inclusion was well implimented and appropriatley balanced. we were also graced with a slightly new approach to the killstreak system, seeing the introduction of attack dogs; along with a tweaked 'create-a-class' system made to feel more period accurate, with bolt action rifles becoming an entierly different weapon type paired with the ability to use their iron-sights, as apposed to being restricted to a telescopic sight. in terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of wwii from both a russian and american perspective; battling the japanesse on iwo jima and beating down the 3rd reich from stalingrad to berlin. featuring the voice talents of keifer sutherland for the american sgt. roebuck, and gary oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails russian sniper - viktor reznov. the campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. the singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other 'call of duty' game. however, my one biggest fault with 'call of duty: world at war' is the unfortunate lack of punkbuster support. the anti-cheat system which now seems abandoned and disused is still required to play some servers in online matchmaking. needing some google searching to find a download of the appropriate files to enable the system to work. although once this is done, the game plays fine and without further fault. oh, and not to mention. zombies. recommended?: yes. score: 9/10"
call of duty: world at war,great game! works on windows 8.1 and i have no problems! pros: *has zombies *costom zombies *no whinney 12 year olds *graphics aren't half bad *one of the best multiplayer for call of duty *costom multiplayer maps *so many mods!! con's: *you haven't bought it yet *it takes like an hour and a half to download
call of duty: world at war,"playing this f#cking game made me notice how much i miss the old ww2 fps games, instead of the new futuristic crap wars that this franchise keeps making up to keep milking blind fans. the thing is, every time i tried to finish this game something happens and i couldn't finish it. well, until now, that is. is this game worth it or not? as usual, i'm gonna explain the bad things it has first, although being honest there's not much wrong with it. first and foremost, the story is split in two different parts of ww2, the americans trying to get revenge after the pearl harbor mess and russia kicking some nazi ♥♥♥. and personally, the american part of the game needed some work. the characters are just so damn bland, even for cod standards. and it even tries to pull the 'suddenly killing an important character infront of you and you can't do anything about it' multiple times, and it fails to get anything because neither i know anything about those character, neither i even care about them. it just means i'll have a different american dumb#ss yelling at me every 10 seconds. going further with the american side of the story, while they offer some nice changes from the rest of the series, they repeat itself a bit too much. seriously, most of the american part of the game is spent crawling in trenches and holes in the ground. one of it's missions has one of the moments i most liked on the game, the whole level on the plane using all of those cool guns and it just makes me wonder why aren't there more of those and less damn holes in the ground. also, the game is kinda short. now sure, cod games always have a short story mode but hell, in modern warfare titles they make up a dumb story behind all of the pew pew pew democracy murrica, here they didn't really need to think of a story as it wrote itself years ago. it lasts around 4 to 5 hours, but will take you more on high difficulties. it ends with a good taste, but it's a bit needlessly short to my refined-afro-fueled taste. lastly, it has some gameplay issues, similar to what you would expect from the rest of this damn ♥♥♥♥♥d franchise. corpses freezing in mid-air, enemies doing nothing but spamming grenades on high difficulties, enemies respawining non-stop and even respawning in between your allies in insane places, that sort of stuff. seriously, don't even bother to use normal grenades in anything that isn't normal or easy difficulty, most times enemies will just pick them up and throw them back at your face. thank motherf#cking mother russia the soviet story has molotovs. all of that being said, what does the game have to offer? well, if you're played games such as the three original cod's or medal of honor (before it went modern warfare ripoff mode) then you'll know what to expect. the story, while being a bit bland on the american side, is quite engaging and fun to go through. specially the russian side of it, which feels like it was done by completely different people, as... ...well, the russian side it's just so f#cking good. amazing music, amazing levels, amazing characters and action, just why couldn't the game be all with them!? i'm not joking. weapons are also great. you know this sh#t feeling you get in pretty much all cod games that any weapon which isn't a sniper rifle or an assault weapon is trash? well, while shotguns still seem to be irrelevant on this game, you'll be surprised to find that pretty much all weapons are useful. i actually do suggest switching and trying them all to find what suits your style more. also, the american vs japan and russia vs nazis stories have different weapons completely, which is a good effort. something that also surprised me were the vehicle sections. both stories have a level in which you're in somewhat control of a vehicle, the americans being the multiple turrets of a big-#ss plane and the russians being a damn vodka-fueled tank of atomic destruction. both of them were actually quite fun, specially the plane one. the game also has coop, although i couldn't try it out this time. i bet it's fun, but i wanted to try it out by myself anyway. the coop that i did try is the nazi zombies mode a long time ago on the xbox360 of a friend, and that sh#t is fun as hell. is the game worth it, then? well, the problem is mainly the price. for 20€ i don't think it is. for that price, either wait for a sale that drops it to 5€ or lower, or just buy it on console, however i do recommend playing it. it's fun, and a good throwback to the classic cod's. tl;dr edition: think of modern warfare 1 but with vietnam flashes and the soviet union suplexing nazis. it's fun as hell, specially the coop with the nazi zombies unlockable mode, but 20€ is a bit way too much."
call of duty: world at war,"campaign: this is by far my favorite campaign in call of duty. the grim, brutal and graphic nature of the campaign really makes the game feel like world war 2, the deadliest war of all time. you play as the soviets against nazi germany in one campaign. you witness the beginning of the war with a grim scene of death and an enticing sniper battle. you then find yourself breaking into the heart of germany and the destruction of the fatherland. you also get to prove yourself as either an emotionless monster or a forgiving soul. you also play as the american's against the japanese. you will witness the japanese banzai tactics and guerilla warfare. you will go from hot, dry out in the open fighting to narrow caves and muddy, rainy hills. you will witness the downfall of the japanese empire from start to finish. both campaigns are very enticing and the missions, although action packed, are memorable and the environment/scenes make it seem realistic. multiplayer: the multiplayer is fun, although sadly their is no matchmaking for pc like their is on console. you have to search through the list of servers. a lot are crouch servers/tactical servers which can be a +1 or a -1. i'm personally fine with it. game also comes with all dlc's so you get all the maps. zombies: yes, zombies. the masterpiece of world at war. it all started here. you get all the zombie maps, plus there is hundreds of custom zombies maps that make the zombies experience endless. this is a big highlight of the pc version. you can easily play with your friends. you can do cheats as well. i'd say the zombies is the best reason to get the pc version over the console versions. graphics: pretty nice for their time. i wouldn't criticize it since the rest of the game makes up for it. overall 9.5/10 i take 0.5 off for the lack of matchmaking. otherwise i love waw and have played it on my friends accounts and have spent atleast 100 hrs on the ps3 version."
call of duty: world at war,worth it for custom zombies maps.
call of duty: world at war,"i love wwii, and this satified me :3 pros -one of the best cod games out there. -good campaign. -love the textures, even on worst video quality. -replaying able. -no dlc!&gt;.&lt; -co-op campaign and multiplayer are fun! -worth all the 25 euros' it cost. -reznooooooov are you reaaal! -kind of realistic, not like codbo2, ghost &amp; avanced warfare. -banzaaaaaaaai! &gt;.&lt; -one of the best wwii games out there (only beated by red orchestra, cod 2 &amp; men of war) -no dlc!&gt;.&lt; -no dlc!&gt;.&lt; -no dlc!&gt;.&lt; -no dlc!&gt;.&lt; -zombies are real :p cons -allways trying to get rid of the m4a1 thompson. doesnt like it at all in cod waw., even though i like it in real life and other games. -i think the campaign might be a little to short, for such a good game. overall -a really good game! 9/10"
call of duty: world at war,"best cod game on steam pro's : all dlc for free , custom zombies , nice co-op / campaign con's : more hacks in one lobby than fingers on one hand. 8/10 would mod zombies again"

call of duty: world at war,"the good old nostalgia. however, unless you have mods or friends who also own waw, it'll be hard to play zombies with a lan party. but again, it was realeased in 2008 so............... finally, it really is worth playing. in other words, when cod was good. r.i.p. cod, you'll be missed. (until battlefield 1 comes out........)"
call of duty: world at war,"cod is like a old model, used to be hot and sexy, but now she's old and it doesnt matter how much makeup she uses because she will never look as good as she used to! rip good cod call of duty 1 - call of duty mw2"
call of duty: world at war,"writing a full-fledged review for this game would take forever, so i'm just gonna do the traditional pros and cons format. pros: +fantastic campaign that keeps you on edge, really expresses the horrors of war +memborable characters +great multi-player, especially with mods, which provide hours of fun +custom zomibies. custom maps, weapons from cod4, space, an airport, you name it +voice talents of keifer sutherland and gary oldman +great price, even better if you can get it during a sale +co-op campaign allows you to experience the joys of the campaign with up to 3 friends +great graphics for its time +wonderfully orchestrated soundtrack ♥♥♥♥ it, i'll be here for a while. cons: -glitches in the campaign -almost no vanilla servers -character models are bugged at the end of the fifth mission -lots of hackers in multi-player 10/10, buy it now"
call of duty: world at war,the last call of duty game worth playing.
call of duty: world at war,simply the game of my life.
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty: world at war. the last game before all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc ports of the call of duty series. world at war (waw) is the fifth iteration in the arcade shooter series that brings wwii elements in the cod universe. waw is made by treyarch a company that has made titles such as 'call of duty: 2' and 'call of duty: 3', so if you have played those you're in for a similar experience just much more shiny. the cod series also has another developer (infinity ward) that switches off on each of the series's games. waw brings a whole new part of the series. a 4-player cooperative game-mode named 'nazi zombies'. the new experience compiles intuitive gameplay like finding the best parts of a level to kill the undead or find out what weapons do the most damage.the campaign is 5-8 hours of shooting mindless enemies on set pieces arranging from the heart of russia to nazi trenches. the multiplayer is class based with a perk system and customizable weapons. if you manage to get a certain amount of kills in a row you earn special kill-streaks. 3 kills is a uav, 5 kills is an artillery strike, and 8 kills in a row you call in dogs to rip your enemies apart. overall call of duty: world at war is a great buy if you like shooting up hordes of zombies all night with your friends. or if you want to have a good time killing your way to the top in the leaderboards on multiplayer. either way your going to have a good time with this game."
call of duty: world at war,pros: unique custom maps with hundreds of features great modding commuinity multiplayer works one of the best cod games to date decent graphics even for 2015 imo since this is mainly arcade cons: mods arent directly in steam workshop though to me it isnt really a problem some maps are hard load without someone informing you of how to use the console this game is a must for me if you enjoy arcade style zombie games etc. the custom maps are amazing and make this much more than just a regular cod game.
call of duty: world at war,this is by far the best call of duty i´ve ever played!!
call of duty: world at war,just great on pc...
call of duty: world at war,"*sigh* god damn i love this game. even with out mods its amazing. from the single player campaign, the flawless multiplayer to the classic zombies, world at war has never ceased to amaze me. 10/10"
call of duty: world at war,"after purchasing a gaming computer, this was one of the first games i downloaded. the best purchase i have made on steam. when world at war first came out, i only had an xbox. i'd watch videos on youtube of custom made zombie maps and i would weep silently as i was restricted to the stock &amp; dlc maps (which are still amazing). call of duty: world at war for pc gaming is everything i thought it would be and so much more. pros: - multiplayer is still popular, i'm normally playing in a server with between 14-40 people. - nazi zombies, with hundreds of custom player made maps. - has 10 prestiges (unlike cod: 4) i find love that they added this for waw. through prestiging, you can unlock 5 additional custom classes, for a total of 10 customizable classes. - singleplayer is incredibly fun and well done. i'm a sucker for ww2 games, so i admit that i am biased. - explosions and certain weapons will dismember enemies. cons: - if you aren't with friends, or you haven't gone onto an online community to play nazi zombies/custom nz, you will more than likely not be able to find a game with a decent ping, which restricts you to sp nazi zombies. you can use cheats to help you out, if need be. - still has a few bugs here and there. the map downfall occasionally crashes my game, and i will occasionally get kicked from servers upon loading new maps. - depending on the server, there will be hackers/try hards/cry babies/trolls. enable punkbuster and you should be okay (for hackers). i also tend to frequent the same 2 servers, which are usually monitored with an admin, and has a clan website where players can upload demos of suspected hackers. - i find 20$ to be excessive for an 8 year old game (call me cheap idk), so i waited for it to go on sale and grabbed it for 10$ all in all, i have to give this a 9/10. the ability to play on customized zombie maps/mods allows you to spend hours trying out new maps or mods. i've been playing the zombie realism mod, which adds in a ranking system, custom classes, prestige mode, weapon challenges, and more. there aren't many 8 year old games that i can still have fun playing, but world at war is definitely one of them."
call of duty: world at war,'you were killed by a grenade. watch out for the grenade danger indicator.' this is a message or tip that you will see quite frequently throughout world at war's campaign on the higher difficulties; hardened and veteran. this is due to the fact that more grenades are thrown at you in this game than there were manufactured during world war ii.
call of duty: world at war,i love this game. brings back old times.
call of duty: world at war,"pretty good game, arguably the last good cod."
call of duty: world at war,why should you get world at war? it's pretty much obvious...
call of duty: world at war,the best game with zombie mode!
call of duty: world at war,"in my opinion, this is a nearly perfect game. it has an ok story, but you will overlook that very quickly as the gameplay and atmosphere captures the horror of world war 2 flawlessly, in both plot lines. in the first plot line, you play as an american soldier battling the japanese, trying to capture an island that is full of booby traps and relentless enemies. this is a very cool way to play, with close quarters combat and ambushes aplenty, making the gameplay very suspenseful. in the other plotline, you play as a russian soldier, firstly trying desperately to survive during a massive german invasion of a russian town, then four years later, in 1945, you enter germany and berlin and brutally crush the german empire in what is a very satisfying set of levels. the first mission where you play as the russian soldier is absolutely groundbreaking, filled with suspense and a dark, powerful atmosphere as you try to escape from the overkill that are the nazis. gameplay is your average call of duty game, it's fun and addictive, but on harder difficulty modes, it is extremely frustrating. even on the easiest difficulty, you can bet that enemies will throw 3 grenades all aimed at you with no time to react. the campaign is very entertaining and while short it has plenty of powerful moments, especially the ending, that was one of the best moments in a game, ever. the game looks absolutely beautiful, for a person that has to run payday 2 on lowest settings windowed to get 30 fps it looks fantastic, even on lowest settings. the music is stunning, even right when you start the game you hear a track that grabs you into the game. sadly, campaign co-op is dead and no-one plays it, so be sure to get friends if you want to play the campaign with someone. multiplayer is very good. on the xbox 360 and playstation 3 versions of the game, it is notorious for everyone to hack and spoil the game. oddly, on the pc version, where it is far easier to cheat, you barely see any cheaters. in general, multiplayer is very well alive and still has a lot of players to this very day, which is good, because multiplayer is very entertaining and amusing to playthrough online. last, but certainly not least, the arcade-style nazi zombies mode. this is one of the best modes ever to be added to a video game, and would you believe it was added last minute? while the zombies mode in call of duty: black ops is flawless and (for some extra money) contains all the waw maps remastered, it's still incredibly fun, and if you ask a friend to play zombies with you, they usually accept. overall, this is an excellent game and one that should definitely be in your steam library. just, don't get it full price, for this old of a game paying £20 is just plain stupid."
call of duty: world at war,remember when call of duty had no dlc........ pepperidge farm remembers.
call of duty: world at war,"difficulty: just right the bottom line: just plain fun/great score: 8.0 note: this game been tried out and reviewed in offline mode or on another steam account and or consoles. it may be a re-skin of cod4 but that just means the good war is back and it's better then ever. despite the grumblings of many, world at war shows there is still a lot of fight left in wwii as a setting. and despite some obvious shortcomings, like the broken audio and straightforward story, world at war is every bit as intense, polished and fun as it's predecessor. the presentation is top notch, with cutscenes that mix real wartime footage with sleek, modern graphics. the short singleplayer campaign is helped by a terrific multiplayer and co-op portion as well as the ever fun nazi mode. world at war doesn't reinvent the wheel by staying snugly in modern warfare's shadow, but it does make for a thrilling and enjoyable ride that fans of wwii and shooters alike are sure to appreciate."
call of duty: world at war,"best call of duty ever made, buy this while its alive because i dont expect any good call of dutys soon"
call of duty: world at war,a very cool game with great nazi zombies co-op :)) great game !!!!
call of duty: world at war,amazingly fun and great community!
call of duty: world at war,"before you criticize my review based on my playtime shown above, i have played this game an absolute ♥♥♥♥ ton on console. with that being said... campaign: it's fun if you're into it. multiplayer: haven't touched it though i assume it's dead. zombies: the reason you should get this game. all the dlc is included free of charge so you don't have to mess with paying more for zombie maps. also, there are tons of custom zombie maps that people have made so you will pretty much never get bored of zombies. the game is incredibly user friendly when loading up custom zombie maps from online so you don't have to install any bull sh*t mods or program to use them. also, while there are some mediocre zombie maps, there are also a ton of well designed maps that in some cases due to easter eggs or new features outshine the ones that the game comes with. to add, because zombies on black ops 1 and 2 aren't exactly mod friendly, custom map makers have turned to integrating a lot of bo1 and bo2 zombies features in world at war. from guns to perks like mule kick and extra pack a punch features like cool looking skins for guns when you pack a punch it, these custom maps become more than just a room with spawn points. hell, there's even buyable endings where you can literally beat the map after you rack up enough points depending on what it's set at (do not confuse buyable with actually having to buy and ending with real money, it's all using the in game points so don't worry about having to pay for extra sh*t. though this may seem like a lot, or a little if you're a skeptic, this is just a surface level review of what there is to offer in this game through custom zombie maps. you do not have to pay for any map that you download (that i know of) and there's plenty of ways to get these maps. personally, i just go to youtube and watch well known zombie players playing custom maps that they think are cool and conveniently they link the download to the map. pretty trusted resource cause, you know, the internet would never lie to me. anyways, here's a tl;dr get this game mainly for zombies. all dlc included and custom maps are easily available and easy to use. imo the custom maps are better than the original ones. worth. 10/10"
call of duty: world at war,this game is the ♥♥♥♥! best campaign ever + zombies + mods + friends + other stuff = mind blown mathmatical ♥♥♥♥! p.s did i mention you can drive tanks? in multiplayer!!!11!!
call of duty: world at war,you'll be saying waw.
call of duty: world at war,i never thought i would of played a zombie map made entirly out of cheese until i bought this.
call of duty: world at war,'golden joystick award for multiplayer game of the year'&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;says it all really!!!.
call of duty: world at war,this is the best wwii call of duty !! sadly it has short campaign :(
call of duty: world at war,"ok..... lets be real... waw xbox 360 or ps3 complete waste of money. the pc version how ever... it literly has 1000's of hours of play time becuase of the ability to get custom maps for zombies!.... if you are a cod zombies fan and you don't own this already tf are you doing with your life. even when this game is at full price its worth it for a !!!!cod zombies fan!!!!.... if in actual case you are a multiplayer fan and u can afford one of the new titles or your potato can't run it i repeat do not think that a game that is very old is going to be a good replacement! you truly have forgoten the face o your father! if you reviewed this game as hacker is multiplayer glitches is multiplayer.... i mean what did u expect! the multiplayer is crawling with hackers and glitchers, this game is only worth getting if you play zombies! if you think your going to get this and actually play multiplayer and enjoy it, where have u been under a rock everyone and his mother knows you only buy this game for zombies! get a life get a better computer or a newer version of cod.. this game, in no way is it a waste of money, if you think it is your the waste, i repeat do what you have to, to get a better computer or more money and stop complaining!"
call of duty: world at war,"great game i recomend it. but only for single player or coop zombies. but if you're getting it for the multiplayer don't even bother. the game litteraly has 0 servers in multiplayer. maybe for you, servers actually show up on the list, but not for me."
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty: world at war is a first person shooter created by treyarch for pc and consoles. originally named ' call of duty 5 ', the game continues, and subsequently finishes, the world war ii setting started from the first game, ' call of duty '. it is the first game within the ' call of duty: black ops ' series, although not branded/labeled as a 'black ops' game itself. it is considered the goriest, most emotionally hard hitting, and realistic call of duty video game to date. call of duty: world at war is a fictional video game depicting the fictional lives of two privates during the denouement of world war ii. the game starts with an american army soldier named private c. miller and his journey throughout the beaches and lands of japan, marching and fighting his way through makin, okanawa, and peleliu island with sergeant thomas sullivan (who is murdered by a japanese soldier early in the campaign), who is later replaced by sergeant roebuck. after the american-sided introduction, the game then switches to soviet union red army soldier private dimitri petrenko, and his journey with sergeant reznov, private chernov, and the rest of the red army as they charge their way throughout stalingrad in russia, to the fields of seelow in germany, and subsequently to berlin as they cut down all in their path, fighting and brutally slaughtering their way into the reichstag, to slice down the facist reich's flag, and to wave ultimate victory over germany for mother russia. campaign ================================ the game starts with the american campaign, with pvt. miller, along with sgt. roebuck and sullivan, charging through makin with their battalions, falling into ambushes, and blowing up an ammo depot. the game, after 3 american based missions, switches to the russian side of the campaign. the russian campaign starts with the player, pvt. petrenko, lying in the slaughter of his comrades after a massacre at a fountain at the red square in stalingrad. the player then continues with sgt. reznov to assassinate a german general named amsel, to avenge the fallen soldiers who had died at stalingrad. afterwards, they escape stalingrad and begin their own adventure to take back russia, and later berlin. the game continues with multiple battles and conflicts, which when paired with sean murray's amazing music, make the whole experience very emotionally hard hitting, and unforgettable. to the russian battle theme, and the 'black cats' fighting theme, the game deliveres an amazing experience that reminisces of the golden days of call of duty video games. zombies ================================ call of duty: world at war intruduces a new 'nazi zombies' mode into the franchise. the mode centers around an operative (or a group of operatives) as they are stranded at a certain base, in need of rescue, from a pending nazi zombie invasion. the group/player must work together/alone to fight their way through the carnage and to escape the compound they are in, being supplied with multiple weapons, and powerups through the way. this mode is definitely worth a try, and a good move on treyarch. multiplayer ================================ with the singleplayer campaign, the game also presents a co-op mode, which allows you to play the campaign with friends. it enables the new 'deathcards' cheats, which reveal special cheats as you collect them throughout the campaign. they're mostly jokes, such as the cheat that replaces all your weapons with stones. i ♥♥♥♥ you not. while the true multiplayer is broken, it can be fixed by following the pc gaming wiki article here [pcgamingwiki.com] . upon fixing the multiplayer, most players will notice that almost all the servers are sadly modded. most servers have leveling cheats enabled, where-in your first 5 minutes of gameplay the player will most likely already be leveled to level 28. i have suffered this, and many others have/will too. ignoring that, the multiplayer is mostly fun. there's multiple modes that will deliver a fun arcade experience for the player. nothing much to say here. issues/bugs/glitches ================================ albeit all the great things about the game, it does present multiple issues. for starters, the game has a failsafe where if the player does not advance at all, it will start spamming grenades at the player until they move forward. on most difficulties, this is usually 1 to 3 grenades. while this doesn't sound too bad, it becomes a terrible experience on veteran difficulties, as the player will most likely have 6-7, even 8 grenades thrown at them at once. the game also suffers from terrible ai issues. an example is in 'vendetta', the first russian campaign mission. during the part where you must protect your comrades as they storm a communications center, sometimes of the ai will become confused, and refuse to navigate. this results in a crash, which you must alt+tab out to see (as the game does not close automatically). sadly, this has happened to me at least 4 times throughout the campaign, with both american and russian campaigns. the ai can also be oblivious to enemies, where they (sometimes) will stand their and absorb bullets until they die, doing nothing. this is most prominant on veteran mode, and leads to an annoying experience, since your comrades will not help you at all during these fire-fights. happily, sgt. roebuck nor reznov will never have these errors; as reznov stays in the back (never moving unless it's a scripted event), and roebuck stays behind cover all of the time throwing grenades and using his pistol. the enemies also feel like they all have aimbot on higher difficulties, and aren't actually aiming for the armies as a whole; just you and you alone. final remarks ================================ i definitely recommend this game to everyone who has a love for first person shooters, war video games, or call of duty games, as this game will find a way to take camp in anyones heart and mind. this game is simply amazing, despite the issues it has, and definitely deserves a chance to be played by everyone. ================================ final rating : 8/10"
call of duty: world at war,"best cod ever. the zombie mode is so f*cking cool, more with custom maps for zombie mode :3. recomended!"
call of duty: world at war,"this game is amazing you can have mods, diffrent maps and there is still a good community on this game even knowing how old the game is."
call of duty: world at war,modded zombies is the best feature of waw on pc! give the game a try
call of duty: world at war,"this is in my opinion, the best call of duty every made. nearly 7 years later and it is still the game that i find myself going back to. treyarch did a phenomical job, and the ww2 era is something that i sorely miss in today's games. not to mention that this introduced the world famous zombie modes. some of the free zombie mods are worlds better than what you can get as paid dlc, or even full games from other sources or consoles. they really outdid themselves with this game. heres to hoping for a w@w 2 this fall!"
call of duty: world at war,"as you know, the cod community is stereotypically a buncha lame, trash talkin' 12 year olds. but that's okay. it has become part of the cod experience. community and overall enjoyment is still better than cs:go."
call of duty: world at war,this is the kinda game where you buy it on wii and then get an xbox and buy it on there and then get a gaming pc and buy it on there each time getting more and more enjoyable. the pc version brings a whole new experince with custom servers and modded zombies. and you cant forget the better graphics on the computer ;)
call of duty: world at war,"the call of duty series completely died out after world at war, in my opinion. black ops and black ops 2 are...okay. black ops 3 is just straight up not that good. world at war is an amazing game, zombies, campaign, multiplayer...whatever the f*ck you guys play, overall, its an amazing game. i believe i first played this on xbox 360 or ps3, but either way, i enjoyed this game a lot more than any other call of duty series."
call of duty: world at war,"custom zombies? yep, only reason."
call of duty: world at war,"play it for the zombie mod maps, there are 1000s of maps out there to play and experiment, lots of replayability with friends . the base game alone is worth it if its on sale atleast 24-48hrs of gameplay on base game alone worth it."
call of duty: world at war,wanna kill japanese people and set them on fire? wanna kill zombies? well this is the game for you.
call of duty: world at war,"great game. you can download many custom maps for zombies, free! definitely worth the 20$ if your computer can run it smoothly."
call of duty: world at war,really fun with the awseome zombie maps
call of duty: world at war,i need some friends to play with anyone down?
call of duty: world at war,"the best cod that has ever been made and always will, cod : waw is the best of all the cods and always will be, they have custom zombies and the campaign is the best of all the cods; it may be an old game but the zombies will always be the best! i mainly like this game for the custom zombies which is amazing and allows users to keep expanding this aging game. 7/10"
call of duty: world at war,it has the original zombies
call of duty: world at war,"the gameplay may be somewhat familiar to nearly all cod ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but this game still stand to be something of one of the best cod games to date. it has mod support, the origional zombies mode and it has a lively community still making mods for ths game. i give this game a 9/11."
call of duty: world at war,"9 gb game and still better than 40 gb of cod ghosts crap... cod used to be good before, they should make more games like this... if you buy this game you won't regret it"
call of duty: world at war,"where do i start emmmm, so yeah there custom zombies ehmm , some custom zombies , oh no way guess what ..... there's custom zombies. really its just worth it 100% just for the zombies athough £20 on steam is alot i'd suggest checking things like ♥♥♥ to get a better deal or wait for a sale that will save you some cash like i did. all round great game , loads of fun solo but if you have freinds to play with it gets even better"
call of duty: world at war,"i love zombies, in special te original story and the custom maps xd"
call of duty: world at war,it's really good
call of duty: world at war,"i played the game for over 2000 hours on ps3 and over 500 hours on xbox 360. this is the best cod man has ever made. singleplayer is epic from the begining of being captured and tortured, to putting that rusian flag up. best cod campaign 10/10. next is zombies. tbh im not a zombies fan however, this has teh best maps for zombies and is just cool. with custom maps aswell that just makes my 7/10 go to a 9/10. wont give 10/10 until i like zombies ;) last is mp. same engine as cod4 in ww2. what is there to hate, fine there not many good servers as they are all 64 man xd. i want a classic 5v5 / 6v6 game to be perfect. there are extra xp / easy prestige servers if you cba to grind and tbh i dont see why you wouldnt use those servers. people say there are hackers but i have seen1 hacker who tried to aimbot but his aimbot missed everytime xd. i would buy this game for the price it is now!!!"
call of duty: world at war,best call of duty ever
call of duty: world at war,"i know i've only played this game for two hours on pc, but i already know what this game is all about from playing both the ps3 and 360 versions of it for years. after experiencing all the annoying ♥♥♥♥ that's plagued the console versions of waw, the pc version was a refreshing change from all the god mode, no clip, infection, infinite ammo, xp hacking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on consoles. another major bonus of waw on pc is custom zombies which, after being able to play as a shotgun wielding patrick star shooting up dozens of bubble buddy zombies, further solidified my love for waw on pc. all in all, if you're a console gamer looking to escape the mess that is waw on consoles, get yourself a decent pc, buy this game (preferably when it's on sale because $9.99 is a hell of a lot better than paying $19.99 for an almost eight year old game), and enjoy waw before it went to ♥♥♥♥ on consoles. oh, one word of advice for console gamers wanting to play this version of waw, the mouse and keyboard makes it easier to aim in this game so don't be surprised when you get sniped dozens of times out of nowhere immediately after you spawn. 10/10 would pop hundreds of bubble buddies with a shotgun and get sniped out of nowhere immediately after spawning again."
call of duty: world at war,"*edit* this is one of the last good call of duty games in my opinion. the black ops series was well put together also, and advanced warfare turned out to be good so far. but i always come back to this cod, because of how simple it is, and the amount of people that still play this game after 6 years of it's release. i love this game, because of the campaign and most of all the zombies. considering that they have a lot of custom maps, it just makes this game worth playing anytime. i recommend this game to anyone who loves to play call of duty and the zombies mode itself."
call of duty: world at war,fun game ww2 so ya not bad like the zombies tho that is the best and u can even get custom maps and play with friends get the game!!!!!
call of duty: world at war,"one of my favorite games of all time. singleplayer is fun, multiplayer is fun and killing zombies was never better"
call of duty: world at war,a really great game to play modded zombies on!
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty is an amazing game all around from everything to its default content, to its mods section. and to be honest, not really hard to connect even with really slow wifi. all round winner :)"
call of duty: world at war,"i love wwii and am a huge fan of it. when i played this, it reminded me of 'the pacific'. it has some similarites and some differences. i hope that after all this advanced type games that are coming out now, they revert back to the old days when their games were actually good and worth $60."
call of duty: world at war,"review multiplayer: used to be very good, now not as good but still good many of the servers are now like fast xp servers which you get like 99999 xp for one kill, maps are nice i think maye a little too big but its ok, weapons are good they are just classic. campaign: nice story with good characters like reznov not much else to say about it but tis a nice campaign but once you complete it its not a thing you really want to go back and do again, it also has co op which is pretty good as well zombies: this is a amazing gamemode the only thing i think makes this game worth the money its so good you have all the dlc maps and the disk map which is very good but the thing that makes it amazing is custom zombies you have endless possibilitys you could have a map filled with santa zombies you could have a map made of cheese you can have like everything its amazing so overall this game is very good, recommend it"
call of duty: world at war,"buy this for one thing, the classic zombies mode. load up on tons of free downloadable maps and have fun with friends...a much more enjoyable experience then the later cod iterations imo."
call of duty: world at war,"hundred times better than the next-gen modern warfare sh*ts. plus, zombie mode is awesome ;o 10/10"
call of duty: world at war,cod waw is the greatest cod in history. playing this game with nazi zombie mods is super fun with friends. bought it for 20$ and was worth every penny
call of duty: world at war,bonzai! -every enemy in the game 10/10 would reccomend the zombies
call of duty: world at war,zis game is 100 times much better than ze call of duty ghosts ♥♥♥♥. i recommend you to play zis game cus its kind a funny you know guys c:
call of duty: world at war,best cod.
call of duty: world at war,awesome game with all the custom zombie maps. highly recommended.
call of duty: world at war,"very easy gameplay for beginners,if you get to know the game and the basics then you're all set..another thing i will mention is the custom zombies their are many custom maps they're very easy to download...thumbs up to the game makers and all the custom map makers!"
call of duty: world at war,this is real cod.
call of duty: world at war,easier to escape from auschwitz than beat this game
call of duty: world at war,pretty good game. weapons and are pretty standard but it's pretty hard to use for new players.
call of duty: world at war,"best call of duty in my opinion, best campaign and multiplayer. they should bring back ww2 games. 9/10"
call of duty: world at war,"best call of duty in my opinion, best campaign and multiplayer. they should bring back ww2 games. 9/10"
call of duty: world at war,"to this day, call of duty: world at war still holds up as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time. to give a full perspective on the game, i will do this review in three parts: campaign: probably the weakest aspect of the game, but still fun to run around play through world war ii environments. its story feels a bit less personal and epic as some of the other titles (modern warfare, black ops), however it isn't by any means bad and can still be enjoyed. the mechanics of the campaign can be somewhat odd, with things like random grenade spawning which cause a bit of annoyance. but, on the whole it's still a fun time. world at war also has a co-op campaign feature, something that has not been seen since in the series. multiplayer: this is where world at war really shines. in general, the game is designed around being skill based, and as such you are rewarded for being a good player. now, that doesn't mean there isn't the occasional iffy mechanic in the game (martyrdom), however most of the time you earn your kills and deserve your deaths. the ttk (time to kill) is higher than other games, making gun accurasy and controlling recoil key. the game has generally very strong maps (castle, cliffside, downfall, nightfire etc.), and each map generally accomidates to a variety of skill sets and has a variety of sightlines (again, reinforcing good aim and gun control being rewarded). all in all, this game has a near perfect multiplayer and to this day remains a great experience. bonus - zombies: although zombies has come to be expected out of modern treyarch call of duty titles, in world at war it was a hidden bonus mode that caught on like wildfire. that's right, world at war is where this whole zombies craze started. there are 4 zombies maps in total (although you can download additional countless ones via user created maps), including my personal favorite map zombies map ever, der riese. however, every map is enjoyable. the biggest weakness in world at war's zombies is the zombie grab, which can often cause frustration and being automatically down with no chance to get away. however, if you're good enough, you can avoid this for the most part. although future games are more refined (and brought these maps back), world at war zombies is still an incredibly enjoyable experience, and has an endless amount of mod content. extra and closing thoughts: as i mentioned in the zombies section, there is a wealth of moddable content for this game. this includes maps, guns, skins, modes etc., essentially creating a game you can spend an infinite amount of time and never be bored. in addition, pc players got all of world at war's dlc content for free! however, it is worth noting that the community [as of mid 2014, 5.5 years after release] is slowly dying out, and you could eventually run into an issue finding a desireable game. that being said, this is an excellent game, one of my personal favorite fps games of all time, and i highly recommend picking it up!"
call of duty: world at war,best game in the world 10/10
call of duty: world at war,this is the best game in the cod series in my opinon. on pc it never end the custom zombie maps are the best!
call of duty: world at war,the only cod game i will enjoy.
call of duty: world at war,zombies? check. no op shotguns? check. no '360 noscopes' and 'quickscopes'? check. no dlc money ♥♥♥♥♥s? check. custom maps for zombies? check. replayability? check. worth buying? triple check. 10/10
call of duty: world at war,the artillery in this game is so realistic it gave me ptsd
call of duty: world at war,"the only good call of duty, people say the older ones are awesome, but they were mediocre compared to this. pros:barely any kids there's a lot of realism involved actual recoil that's not fake engine trash. snipers aren't offensive and snipers don't quickscope. infact, it's impossible to quickscope since sniper in waw actually takes skill on aiming because of breathing patterns and shuttering. most alive cod on pc historically accurate on world war ii. cons:what ♥♥♥♥ing cons? it's one of the best 'modern' fpses ever made."
call of duty: world at war,the hardest call of duty game they've ever made in the history.also it's the second best cod besides modern warfare 1
call of duty: world at war,"got me fingers wet the day after getting tenth prestige on this back in the day, coincidence? i think not #realtalk"
call of duty: world at war,the biggest rush b in the history of man
call of duty: world at war,"this game is a blasr, and is deffinately not dead, way gnarlier than on consoles,, 32v32 multiplayer?!?! thank you"
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty world at war is a classic world war 2 first person shooter. infact it is one of the better ones. in the singleplayer campaign you switch between two fronts: the japanese-american and the russian-german front. both stories are alright, but the russian one has way more character development than the american one. the multiplayer is your basic call of duty multiplayer, but with (of course) ww2 guns. the multiplayer has small, but also some bigger maps. on some big maps you can even use tanks to destroy your enemies. after beating the capmpaign you unlock the zombie mode 'nazi zombies', which is the best thing about this game. fight the undead horde round by round as long as possible. arms yourself up with guns and perks and slay em all &gt;:3. this game also supports mods. there are many mods for this game which add more zombie-maps to play on. the modding community is still active. if you like ww2 and zombies cod waw is the game for you."
call of duty: world at war,"omg this game is awesome, world war 2 has start and you have to be ready to fight against germans and japanese the camping of this game is awesome and its realy long compare to other call of dutys. there are some multiplayers server so you can join the battle with friends, but the best part its zombies, if you get bored from the 4 zombie maps you have, you can also download a lot of maps from internet and play them with friend. 89/100"
call of duty: world at war,do you like zombies? do you like custom zombie maps? multiplayer is very hard but it can be fun!!
call of duty: world at war,"a campaign that will give you tons of hours of fun. even after replaying it for the 30th time, it's still great... and then there are zombies. 4 awesome maps that started the entire story. multiplayer is still great. prestige mode, customization and op weapons :3"
call of duty: world at war,"one of the damn best cod games out there. great campaign, nice multiplayer, and it started the hype of zombies. get it for custom maps :3"
call of duty: world at war,"this is the only call of duty game that actually doesnt suck. custom zombies are good, multiplayer is actually great and there is no hackers thanks to this new plugin thats on every server :d and there was a online bug to create a profile that was actually easy to fix so if you have this problem just google it and you will find your fix quickly :d."
call of duty: world at war,"i loved this game back in it's release and i just had a hit of nostalgia for it, so i bought it on the ps3 and found out it was hacked really bad, and i was told hacker's are virtually non-existant on the pc version, i'm glad i bought this on pc! hackers report: hacker threat: minimal activity level: moderately high overall, great game."
call of duty: world at war,last game that was good in the series...
call of duty: world at war,"probably one of the best cods.the multiplayer is a lot of fun.the weapons are just epic.driving a panzer is even more exciting.the campaign is interesting enough,and you can play it with friends.zombies-the best part of this game,the default ones are perfect,but the custom zombie maps make the game very very unusual (in a good way) campaign:8/10 multiplayer:8/10 zombies:9/10"
call of duty: world at war,this game will make you fap even harder than you fap regularly.
call of duty: world at war,"holy ♥♥♥♥! this is the best call of duty game ever made! world at war number five in a series of too many games! raahagrhgahgha! this game will blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of your ♥♥♥♥ and your brain out your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! delicious! the campaign is full of heartfelt moments such as [spoilers] and [spoilers]! tears of manliness! sure! do you like murdering mindless enemies on the field of combat! no? well then this game is for you! spray the blood of nazis and japs all over walls! gorey hell of a mess to clean! and if you think its over... no! there are ♥♥♥♥ing zombies! holy ♥♥♥♥ on a biscuit! re-kill the japs and nazis you already killed! they only live twice! and if youre sick of the original map mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of the game with new zombies maps and other mods for other things! what the absolute ♥♥♥♥ is that, i hear the sound of actually multiplayer! where people can tolerate the people on the other side of the screen! oh my diddily ♥♥♥♥! so if you like this game say 'i' and if you don't like this game say 'i hate america' the defense rests! 10000/1"
call of duty: world at war,one word: (custom) zombies
call of duty: world at war,"everybody buys this game for zombies, which is amazing, but i think that the rest of the game was and is highly underrated. the story mode is rich and exciting. multiplayer is still very good to play on. i've had little to no trouble finding games and the servers have very few if any cheaters on them. because it is a call of duty it uses the same gameplay mechanics that the most current one uses so to this day it still feels like a modern shooter. i would highly recommend this game... but wait for it to be on sale because it is not worth $20."
call of duty: world at war,extremely fun game to play with your friends. i can never get enough of the custom zombie maps that people are still making for this game. when playing on regular multiplayer you will need to watch for aim botters. it is not that wide of a issue so you wont run in to many. overall one of my favorite games to play.
call of duty: world at war,best ww2 sim out there cant w8 for call of duty vietnam.
call of duty: world at war,this is one of my absolute fav cods for pc thanks to moded zombies! you can't go wrong with world at war.
call of duty: world at war,"do you have friends? of course you do, everyone has friends. get 3 of your friends to buy this game and play co-op with you. the campaign is identical over co-op as single player, and its fun as hell! step 2, go rent a teamspeak server because skype sucks. jump on that mic and run through the campaign with your friends in one caffiene fuled night of pure call of duty bliss. enjoy the call of duty franchise before it got ruined with 13 year olds on xbox live, a lack of dedicated servers, and constant product endorsements from mountain dew and doritos! -pr0xidian"
call of duty: world at war,best cod in the franchise.
call of duty: world at war,got a gun were it made zombies into russian soldiers. i then made a army of angry russians. 11/10 would make an army again
call of duty: world at war,if a friend has this game you must game share!! my dad did that it is amazing game for when it came out!!!!!!!! i say 1000/10
call of duty: world at war,one of the best cod games of all time! this cod game introduced zombies to the community and people loved it. not to mention there are custom zombie maps which you can download for free. 10 outta 10 would play again
call of duty: world at war,"great game! real weapons, real war. we need more games like this one! not the modern fairytales with flying soldiers like black ops 3 or aw! activision, can you hear your fans?"
call of duty: world at war,"this is by far one of the best call of dutys, more people play this game then some of the new version eg black ops 2 custome zombies normal zombies multiplayer coop amazing campaign do i need to tell you more? get it now!!! while it's half price! it's a great deal!"
call of duty: world at war,"this game is absolutely amazing. many people consider it the last good cod came, and i wont say their wrong. the campaign is intense, although quite gory. the only downside i have founde is that almost every multiplayer server is hacked so you can barely play. the primary reason i got this game was for zombies. well, custom zombies. if you didn't know, you can download maps as a mod and play them. you could also make them, but thats extremely difficult. overall, this is a great game and worth every penny."
call of duty: world at war,best call of duty game ever. playing it in 2015.
call of duty: world at war,"to start the review there are four words you need to know about this game:'one of the best!'the rest of the review will consist of things that are great about this game in numerical order.1.amazing graphics-imressive.2.the dual battling campaign is amazing with the russians battling the germans and the americans over in japan.3.nazi zombies is the best mode ever-there are all most unlimited downloadable mapsto choose from such as zombiemodding and ugx_maps. some maps are straight up hilarious and other, battling to your last breath.4.npc's-npc's in this game are not those other npc's who shoot at walls over and over again and don't act like you want them to. 5.multiplayer-this is never ending fun! i love themaps where you can drive tanks and battle tank vs. tank battles.6. tis game is never laggy for me and my computer isn't the newest computer out there.7. if i had to rate this game it would be a 10/10, totally get this game!"
call of duty: world at war,call of duty: world at war is a blast! the campaign got boring after the first couple of missions and there isn't a multiplayer community anymore but zombies is so much fun! there is such an awesome custom zombies community and soooooo many maps you can play aside from the maps that come with the game! if you are into survival or wave type games then this is a must have and you need to buy this now!
call of duty: world at war,"a really good fps shooter. one of the best in the cod series. the campaign is good, but i'm not too big of a fan of the multiplayer. the best part of the game is zombies! i just love zombies. in my eyes, this game could have been made just for zombies, but that's me. i wish the cod team can go back to these kind of games and expecially zombies, i will definetly buy it, if they do."
call of duty: world at war,10/10 game custom zombies is amazing!
call of duty: world at war,"this is an honest review of call of duty: world at war there's few games that really outshine this one. i've been playing this game for a long time, even though it says i've only got 70 or so hours at the moment. my favorite gamemode is by far the zombies, don't get me wrong, the campaign and multiplayer are fantastic. but the zombies is where this game really shines in my opinion. pros: -awesome story -huge multiplayer maps with vehicles -extremely realistic hardcore mode -zombies -custom, downloadable zombies and multiplaer maps -an actually quality level pc port cons: -small-ish community -very hard to get into low-ping public zombies servers -graphics are outdated (not that it really matters to me, but it's a con for most people) -crashes happen when you try to switch your online profile -tanks are op (as they should be, but its none the less annoying) final verdict: overall, you could have many hours of fun with your friends in this game. if you have no friends who play this game, it is less of a rewarding experience. if you do buy this game, i would highly recommend playing through the campaign, it is really worth your time. score: 9.5/10"
call of duty: world at war,two words; custom zombies :3
call of duty: world at war,"this is the only cod what i like, the campaing is cool and the best is't the nazi zombies. this game don't have all thoose fuc.kings dlc of 15 dolars with zombies and ♥♥♥♥ maps, if you want more nazi zombies maps you can download from internet free."
call of duty: world at war,the fact that this game openly allows you to mod it is one i enjoy! mods are the reason i believe today some people still play the game!
call of duty: world at war,world at war is a good call of duty game. you can make custom mods or maps for zombies. zombies is good.
call of duty: world at war,"this game is absolutely perfect. instead of some weird ♥♥♥♥ing exo movements, bo2 and under were the best cods. you get zombies. fair guns. cool multiplayer. and a good campaign. when i play aw i shoot 201023 times and no bullets hit. the only thing is they need to add kino der toten for zombies . just sayin' :3, 10/10 would flashbang if i could"
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty: world at war is a great game. the campaign is engaging and replayable, the multiplayer is fun and enjoyable, and the zombies mode that was introduced from this game that is still in the newer treyarch titles is a fun game to play with friends. pros- [campaign]- good story and characters, engages you, challenges you, and is only the lead into the stories of bo1 and 2. [mp]- people still play this almost 9 year old game. [mp]- guns are varying, meaning you aren't going to get killed by one gun and one only (but beware of ppsh users) [zm]- simple and easy to learn. [zm]- fun for co-op or online. [zm]- custom zombies. [campaign]- this is a personal opinion, but this game is gorey-er than other cod campaigns, and i think it impoves immersion cons- [campaign]- although i said its challenging, sometimes it's too much so. [campaign]- the pacific theatre gets boring towards the end, and you almost want it to end there. [mp]- juggernaut. enough said. [mp]- anymore, most servers are not vanilla, meaning it will probably be modded in some way. [zm]- it gets repetitive after a while, due to simplicity. final verdict- campaign- 8.75/10. it's good, but not amazing. multiplayer- 9/10. probably the best multiplayer in a cod game. zombies- 9.5/10. the second best zombies mode so far, only behind black ops 1. overall [average of all scores]- 9.11/10. my favorite cod, and to many others one of the best in the series."
call of duty: world at war,"( first impression review ) awesome game though can't find a single person to play classic zombies :/ but overall good game love it though the multiplayer is something eh i'm not use to lol i've played through black ops and mw3 multiplayer and waw's multiplayer is way better it feels way down to the game for new players i haven't seen stuff like this in along time my vote 10/10 recommend you buy it :d ( edit 1) after playing this game for x ammount of tme and running it through 'most' of it's paces i've decided to edit my review of this game, the game is great all around but in some aspects/features it lacks so i'ma get down to my review at the bottom of this starting with the story mode. 1. story mode/single player- i found this game's story quite good though it's very laggy and hard to get into at first i give it a 5/10. 2. story mode/co op - when playing the story mode with friends my game as well as theirs would crash for no appearant reason and i have yet to find the cause i give the co op story mode a 2/10 3. networking/match making - when joining a co op round with a friend in rare times either person was unable to join the other's match and i have yet to find a cause or a fix to this issue and it is quite rare i give networking/matchmaking a 6/10 for all around. 4. solo mode zombies - i find this one of the best modes of the game i love it the most cause i can sit and play even with out cheats and go very far in waves or rounds and have music playing with out worrying about my team mates i give solo mode zombies a 10/10 5. co op zombies - i find it hard to find a match for zombies it's sometimes none existant when it is most of the time it's modded maps or people using cheats of some kind but for just private matchs with friends i give the co op zombies a 10/10 for online use i give it a 0/10 because i can't play in a public match because it's mostly private premade teams now. 6. multiplayer - i like the multiplayer of world at war but most of the servers are either using cheats or mods and it's extremely hard to find a match enless you custom search one for with out mods or cheats that is in the game mode you desire, also with most servers the health is very low that being said in most servers the bullets that it takes to kill you are around 3 to 5 rather than almost a full clip depending on the right happen i find this a major disappointment because it's hard to find the guy and shoot him before he shoots me and most times it's a one shot from accross the map so i give multiplayer a 6/10. 7. graghics/ effects - i have yet to put these through their paces because i'm still running on low settings because my laptop sucks but when i get my new computer and re run this game at max i'll revise my review and add my rating on these but for now i can't. 8. sound effects - i have to give the sound effects a strong 9/10 they are superb 99 times in each match depending on the weapon. 9. mechanics - the game is old that being said i can't even give it a strong review on these because of it being as old as it is so i'ma give the mechanics a 10/10 for them being as old as they are 10. playerbase - this game has good playerbase alot of nice peopl and such and it's very easy to get a co op or co op zombie match going this being said i give it a 10/10 11. taking out of all my reviews i give the entire game a 8/10 for it's age and the fact that in some features i can't really put them through their full potential yet i will however do so when i get a better computer."
call of duty: world at war,we need more players!!
call of duty: world at war,but i'm not done yet
call of duty: world at war,tl;dr at the bottom my second favorite call of duty!
call of duty: world at war,"7/10 - campaign = great | multiplayer = near death the campaign is amazing. still really fun to play. typical awesome cod. multiplayer is basically dead. there are some servers, but with heavy rules it's less fun to play than back in the day. most servers are crouch only. worth $10 for campaign. accidently reviewed"
call of duty: world at war,there was a war but not for the world
call of duty: world at war,best game ever: if you like first person shooters that revolve around ww2 then this is your game with so many ways you can play coop multiplayer and a zombie mode in coop and singleplayer this is one of the best ww2 actions games you will ever play
call of duty: world at war,this is pretty much the only cod game that is the best and does not suck apart from cod4. this supplies the best zombies and custom zombies. much cod games do not provide this awesome zombies and supply remakes which are terrible. this is the only zombies game that doesn't suck and guess what. all the hackers are excluded from this game unlike all the mw. remember when cod was good? no? well here it is.
call of duty: world at war,this game is amazing!!! i mostly play for the zombies but the campaign is also amazing and it's totally a game worth buying... and figuring out how to get custom zombies map's isn't that hard... maybe if anyone has the same maps as me we could play online! but anyway great game! / 10/10!!!
call of duty: world at war,good game to play with friends especially zombies 10/10 ign
call of duty: world at war,if only this game was remastered with modern graphics.....
call of duty: world at war,"unlike with my black ops 2 review, this game comes as one game under your steam library but is a 3 part game, campaign, multiplayer and zombies. so i will be doing the one review for the parts individually. waw - campaign its veteran campaign is the hardest campaign i have ever completed on any game ever. regardless of wether it is a cod or battlefield or friggin' the sims, i don't care it's purely hard. unfortunately (or fortunately in this case) the steam version of this game does not have achievements so i cannot prove i have completed it on veteren, and honestly i havent completed it on veteren on steam. i completed the veteren campaign on the ps3 version of this game a long while back before i started pc gaming. after having gotten every single achievement and my platinum trophy i vowed to never ever ever attempt this veteren campaign again. as i said earlier unfortunately this version doesnt have achievements so i dont have enough reason to attempt such a feat again to prove my worth. i can assure you back in the day there was much rage, controller throwing and much swearing loudly. i have since barely ever raged again, im pretty sure it's because no matter how hard something is or how much better a player in a multiplayer game is than me, there is always this veteren campaign that is harder. having said all of that i really enjoyed the campaign, despite it being clearly quite old by todays standards it's quite a fun campaign (as long as you are not attempting it on veteren) waw - multiplayer this game is old and this does reflect in the multiplayer games. there are quite a lot of one shot lobbies in the multiplayer mode, it seems to be the more popular due to how much fun the sniper rifles are in this game and how old it is too i guess. you can find some normal team deathmatch games here too but its not a super busy game on the multiplayer servers from what i have seen, most people will have moved on to the newer cod multiplayer games i imagine. waw - zombies this is the game mode that you buy this game for. world at war created zombies, this was the first ever cod game to put a zombies mode in. having said that you only get one base map which isnt that great. what is pretty great is that all of the dlc for the steam version of this game is completely free so you can get 3 other zombies maps too. this is unlike the ps3 version i played many moons ago in which i had to buy all the dlc. the dlc zombies maps on this game do pale in comparison to the newer cod games with zombies but that is to be expected since its the first time they have existed in cod. so that is awesome you have 4 zombies maps just like the console versions. lol. this is pc ♥♥♥♥♥es!!!! for the pc version of this game you have a whole community based on zombies. there are literally thousands of custom built maps for this game. you can find such maps all completely free to download at many numorous websites that host links to maps made by custom mappers. you can see hundreds and thousands of videos on youtube if you pretty much just type 'custom zombies' into youtube search bar to see huge varieties of maps. there are maps that are designed entierly from the map makers imagination or maps made based on real life enviroments wether it be the mappers workplace, house or local supermarket. there are maps based on tv shows such as the simpsons, family guy, spongebob squarepants, my little pony - yes i said my little pony!! even i myself have made a few custom maps - the mod tools are free for anyone to use to create your own maps usually available from the many websites that host these maps alongside tutorials on how to use them and many forum posts giving advice on how to use them. so that is why you buy this game pretty much only for the custom zombies maps, you could spend probably over 2000 hours playing every single map for like 30 minutes each easy with probably some maps you could spend a few hours playing. some of the websites you can find custom maps and tutorials on how to make your own etc: zombiemodding.com ugx-mods.com undeadmodding.com triple-mgames.com and so on, there are tonnes of them :p"
call of duty: world at war,comm'on! this game doesn't need a review
call of duty: world at war,"best ww2 shooter there is. love the multiplayer and zombies. plenty of custom zombie maps to play on, it doesn't get boring. played it since 08 on ps3"
call of duty: world at war,"honestly one of my all time favorite cods, no other cod has ever had the same spirit as waw. waw felt terrifying at times, the match will get quiet until you hear the echo of a rifle crack across the map, taking out your teammates leg in a horrifying fashion. this was the only cod to ever actually feature real gibbing (aside from zombies and that scene in cod 4 where you shoot someones arm off). i always make fun of cod for being mindless and such but this one is considered (to me) to be the best and i would recommend it to anyone. its replayability is almost infinite as long as there are friends and good servers. also there are custom zombie maps if you get bored or just want a break from the originals."
call of duty: world at war,"man, we need another call of duty game like world at war. the campaign, the online multiplayer, nazi zombies. all done insanely well! also, nazi zombies in this game has a great modding community."
call of duty: world at war,"this is the best cod ever because of custom zombies, good campaign and free dlc"
call of duty: world at war,this game is the best call of duty game if you like zombies. it is more open to custom content and has thousends of custom maps zombies and multiplayer. the engine it runs on is the cod 4 engine whitch is sectaculer and the gamplay is soled. this is one of thos games you can spend hours on what the dev team has given you and even more to witch the custom comunity gives you. i like this game more then eny other cod and i think you will to
call of duty: world at war,"looking for cool coop game ? it here call of duty world at war -great camping -bloody -banzaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii -coop + zombie + custom map but where to download custom map ? ugx-mods , zombiemodding ----------------------------------------------------------------- ผมคนไทยเองแหละ :p มาเล่นด้วยกันเยอะๆนะครับ ภาคนี้เป็นภาคช่วงสงครามโลก ดิบๆ เถื่อนๆ ยิงหัวระเบิด (bo หัวไม่ระเบิด) เกมนี้เหมาะสำหรับคนชอบเล่น coop นานๆครับ โดยเฉพาะ โหมด zombie เป็นอะไรที่โครตสนุกเลยครับ coop 4 คน ยิ่งเล่นนานยิ่งสนุก และ ยังมี custom map รองรับด้วยครับ ยิ่งเล่นยิ่งสนุก"
call of duty: world at war,great game..... awsome custom maps
call of duty: world at war,"great game! it still has many multiplayer servers to play on and has a good campaign. the zombies are great, especially because you can get custom maps and each offers a new and unique zombie experience."
call of duty: world at war,buy this game!!! nazi zombie.... fun and you can play custom made maps... and you can make one!
call of duty: world at war,better than the black ops series...
call of duty: world at war,this game has the best zombie mode. plus it has custom maps.
call of duty: world at war,good game one of the best cods but this game is not supported anymore which can make coop/zombies etc a hassle
call of duty: world at war,"an amazing story, great characters, and surprisingly supurb graphics make it one of the best games in the call of duty franchise. recently, they've just been focusing on the gameplay/weapons/utilities rather than the story itself. another cool thing is, this still has a community of players -- +1,000 players strong. 8 years after release, it remains as one of the most well made cod games."
call of duty: world at war,"great game because you can download custommaps for zombies,"
call of duty: world at war,"this game is my first cod and it was the last classic ww2 cod. about mp, sp and zombies: sp: story was good liked that you can gib the enemy. coop was good mp: like you are in ww2 zombies: op custom zombies are good good story by treyarch it was so good that they brought it back on black ops good times never come back r.i.p. classic nazi zombies"
call of duty: world at war,african space jesus approves!
call of duty: world at war,two words... custom zombies!
call of duty: world at war,its fun to play some custom z's
call of duty: world at war,"mother f**cken best game ever made! just kiding... but siriusly, i find my self going back to this game over and over and over and over and over again, again, and again. i don't understand how the mods of this game can be soooo addicting... but they sooo are! i see this game turning into a classic in the not too distand future."
call of duty: world at war,definitely my favorite cod! the story was awesome and the graphic is fine to me. best thing about this game is obviously nazi zombies! it's soo addicting and i love playing it with friends. 9/10
call of duty: world at war,this is great combined with zombie realism
call of duty: world at war,"recently bought this game on steam (put in alot of hours before on non-steam edition) its a great game, my favorite part is the 4 player co-op option for the campaign, i don't understand why more games don't have this kind of feature. along with that the storyline is heck of all fun, its not take one level and then copy-paste it and call it a campaign, the missions are actually unique through the entire game! the multiplayer is fine, its frustrating when people start camping in buildings, but its pretty rewarding to kill them and claim your revenge! by now most likely you're probably getting this game for zombies, still somewhat active, but i wouldn't recommend playing on pub matches, playing with friends is really the only way to play this game, which is an awesome way to play. 7/10 (zombies doesn't have a whole lot of maps, not a great many zombies matches, even then you do get kicked out of some of them, and multiplayer is frustrating at times, thats why its not 10/10)"
call of duty: world at war,"god knows, it's incredible!"
call of duty: world at war,one of the last good cod's i recommend this greatly.
call of duty: world at war,fun game.all i did was play custom zombie maps.
call of duty: world at war,fun game.all i did was play custom zombie maps.
call of duty: world at war,awesome if you have custom zombie maps :d
call of duty: world at war,"custom zombies gives this game so much replay vaule. if you love zombies, then you'll love this game!"
call of duty: world at war,"it was fun at first, but then i set up a controller and now i cant get it to use keyboard and mouse if someone wants to help, send me a message"
call of duty: world at war,i love this game
call of duty: world at war,its fun and the custom zombies provide hundreds of hours of replayability and they're free
call of duty: world at war,got gassed by hitler 10/69 would buy multiple copies
call of duty: world at war,call of duty: world at war old but gold
call of duty: world at war,"this is one of the call of duty games that i seriously recommend everyone should get it, there is a metric ton of mods due to the sheer amount of mods that have come out for this game, pretty much any gun in the call of duty series can be found here, due to the engine being the same the features can be added as well, all the other zombie maps are in this game, all the modes, all the sounds, all the fun, all the content. granted it works best when you have a friend to play this game with as that is when it will really shine, espeically the zombies modes with all of the custom maps that it can provide. if you like hoard style shooters or just want a solid fps then this is certainly a game that should be on your radar even 7 years after it came out."
call of duty: world at war,"this game is insane. the story mode is sick, multiplayer is ok++ and the zombie mode is &lt;33. yes i have 0.7 hours on pc, but probably 500hours+ on ps3. imo this is the best call of duty game ever made."
call of duty: world at war,zombies. thats it
call of duty: world at war,always fun. yeah. take my word for it. yeah.
call of duty: world at war,a great ww2 game! but i have only clocked 10 hours as it is beaten by other games. nice to see the old zombie maps back!
call of duty: world at war,"remaster world at war please for 2017 !!! final world war ii game by call of duty , introducing the battlefront upon the pacific featuring the battle at okinawa and other major battles along the turning tides of pacific. along the starts of the pacfic the major focus on the eastern front on the advance of the soviet red army into nazi germany , including battles such as the battle of stalingrad ,seige of berlin. however the main focus on private reznov on his story upon the leading events in call of duty black ops . overall the multiplayer gameplay is very lacking as it faces the road of extinction with its population dying day by day . the best part of the game in focused on zombies as the game introduces the new zombie mode and first maps such as nachet de toten , verruckt , shi no nu ma and der ries , overall interesting game for everyone to consider getting ! game is still alive !!!"
call of duty: world at war,"enjoyable campaign and multiplayer, but nothing beats the zombies mode - with huge amount of free, user-created maps!"
call of duty: world at war,love this game ! that game' s so awesome :d
call of duty: world at war,so this is the best cod ever! is there anyway to bypass the story and skip right to nazi zombies? if anyone could message me on steam and lmk that would be very helpful! also the multiplayer is not dead. i thought it was at first but just clicked refresh and it went from zero servers to like a hundred!
call of duty: world at war,they just don't make 'em like they used to.
call of duty: world at war,"how to play cod waw: 1: buy the game. 2: see that the zombie mode is modable. 3: forget about campaign. 4: play some mod map on zombies. 5: when you get bored of that, you try multiplayer. 6: once you get on a server, you see a bunch of hackers. 7: ragewuit because of the hackers. 8: repeat 2-8. 10/10 best game"
call of duty: world at war,yup. i wrote a cod reccomendation. other than cod4 this is the only game in the series i can reccomend.
call of duty: world at war,"those who is familiar with the previous call of duty, can't imagine world at war. take modern warfareкраткая information on game with its mechanics of fight, chernobyl dogs murderers, branchy russian 'cranberry' and send to world war ii era. to take away reproaches in secondariness (eventually, on this lawn cod 1, 2 and 3 were trampled down), add the mad japanese, the torn-off extremities, a mode of joint passing on four, expanded system the multipleernykh of 'perok' and the mini-game nazi zombies. ah yes, and the tank with self-repairing armor. call of duty: world at war — some step back in comparison with last game of a series, call of duty 4: modern warfare. the plot instead of the present offers again us cloyed world war ii, however, with not the most boring campaigns — the usa here battle to japan, and to punish germans honor dropped out to the soviet soldiers. game process thus doesn't have ingenious statement, that is here, of course, both beautiful rollers, and qualitatively zaskriptovanny events, and various unexpected situations, but everything is made strictly 'on the four', it is no more. as a result game which we will remember hardly in a year — so turned out, to take place, a little посражаться in a multiplayer and to forget. (this my opinion and it can not coincide with yours)."
call of duty: world at war,this game is only good for zombie map mods lmao
call of duty: world at war,in reality this was my first cod game i played and i feel like there is no game from the hole series that can match this game with the custom maps and zombies maps that are out of this world :d so this is not in reality a waste of money because even the storey mode is amazing
call of duty: world at war,10/10 this game is the best zombie survival game and always will be
call of duty: world at war,an amazing racing gameonly plays well with steering wheel and gas peddel usb controllers. 10/10
call of duty: world at war,i just went back playing this game cause i watched saving private ryan at my school. dope
call of duty: world at war,i brutally murdered several million jews. this game is almost as hardcore as amazingworld
call of duty: world at war,get this game for the sick custom nazi zombies maps and the classic multiplayer
call of duty: world at war,"i want to start by saying, that the only reason i bought this game was to play zombies... not campaign, and not multiplayer. just zombies. and seeing how so far i have 50+ hours of playing zombies. i think that this game fulfilled its purpose of entertaining consumer. i love the custom maps that you can download and i enjoy zombies a lot. if you are thinking of buying this game also just because you want to play zombies, do not think any longer and just go ahead and purchase this game!"
call of duty: world at war,"one of my favorite games, special features from custom maps make the game almost better, zombies are awesome. recommended."
call of duty: world at war,"good campaign, great zombies, and the fact you can get custom zombies is outstounding"
call of duty: world at war,i played a zombie map made of cheese... if that isn't your selling point i don't know what is.
call of duty: world at war,modded/custom zombie maps make this game totally worth it!!! the main game is amazing aswell.
call of duty: world at war,i love this game great zombies co-op
call of duty: world at war,"&gt;playing a modded map for literally hours trying to beat it &gt;hours of training zombies, trying to do a puzzle &gt;friend finds a mystery box after hours of searching &gt;gets wierd ♥♥♥ nades that do random ♥♥♥♥ &gt;throws one &gt;both ♥♥♥♥ing go down &gt;gets noose and gun out &gt;uninstalls"
call of duty: world at war,"screaming every disgusting thing i can think of about my enemy's mom, i rage quit multiplayer. it's time for hot pockets. truly this is the greatest generation. 10/10"
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty: world at war; this is the best cod hands down. despite it's 2008 release date, this cod game remains the winner of the best cod (my opinion, don't get your ♥♥♥♥ into a twist) due to the harshness of the war, the astounding (not entirely hacked) multiplayer, and my personal favorite, nazi zombies. while this game may have been made in 2008 don't think the community is dead, daily custom zombie maps are being made which offers unlimited replayability meaning that for a 2008 game, it has more content than all the other cod's put together. the multi-player is also amazing, if you choose a non hacked lobby i guarantee you will have an awesome time on it, without having to worry about all those 10-13 year olds who 'sleep' with your mom. as for the campaign, it puts you in the place of different people fighting on different sides during ww2, it is harsh, bloody, and total hell on veteran difficulty. perfect for gorehounds like me who like a challenge :) . there should be no reason to not pick this game up if you have the funds. since for $20 it has offered 200 and counting hours of fun gameplay. anyway, why are you still reading this review, stop and buy waw you c,unt. :p (i still play this game and i don't mind receiving requests from people who would like to play -edit 7/16/16)"
call of duty: world at war,this game taught me more about world war 2 than my history teacher xdddddd
call of duty: world at war,"pro: -custom zombies -campaign -normal zombies -graphics(for 2008) -optimization -custom zombies -can play the campaign co-op -did i mentioned custom zombies? :d cons: -multiplayer doesn't has too many servers(and mostly are hardcore) highly reccomended:9,5/10"
call of duty: world at war,"custom zombies is amazing! the campaign is really good, multiplayer is full of fun hacks!"
call of duty: world at war,"great game, but beware of multiplayer issues. when i bought the game multiplayer would not work and i was stuck in a loop, to fix this i just had to portforward two ports, 28960 for tcp/udp and 3074 for udp and then run the game and it was good. mods also make the game really fun, would recommend."
call of duty: world at war,the ability to have custom maps and have fun with them using console this game is awesome zombies mode ftw
call of duty: world at war,would play zombies again 99/9
call of duty: world at war,probably my favourite campaign in the cod franchise it brings back memories of me and my friends playing co-op getting the ray gun on the second mission and blowing off limbs! fun times :')
call of duty: world at war,cool game i recomendet to any one who likes custome zombies
call of duty: world at war,not a great fan of fps but this seems ok.
call of duty: world at war,this has taken away many days of my life. i can't keep myself from going back to it. but it's worth it. you get to kill zombies in a brand new and inifite way with custom maps. endless hours of fun with friends. just simply one of zombie players most reccomended thing to play. 11/10 would buy again
call of duty: world at war,this game is the reason i went pc and am now on steam. custom zombies all day!
call of duty: world at war,"probably the last really good cod game until black ops 2 came around. get it for the action packed story and retro multiplayer. and stay for the zombies, which the community has taken into a massive extent with custom maps galore for hours upon hours of fresh undead slaying fun. comes with all previously released dlc i believe. honestly i'd reccomend it just for the zombies alone"
call of duty: world at war,custom zombies ftw.
call of duty: world at war,"nazi zombies is a really good game. there is a small minigame you can play on the side called 'call of duty', but that game is garbage just stick to the other stuff. 10/10 would play again."
call of duty: world at war,one word: awesome but for real this game was my first cod and will always have a place in my heart. it has everything. a cool and interesting story line when you switch between 2 different soldiers. one fighting japan and the other taking back russia. but the best part comes when you play zombies. when i first played this game on my xbox all i did was play zombies. it was what made me get into zombies today. a couple years latter i get a good computer and buy this game. my friend tells me to download this map for zombies called cheese cube. so i did and i had a blast. this game is amazing and forever will be my favorite cod. -unscripted
call of duty: world at war,"what is there to say about cod: waw? other than it is basically the best cod out there to date, and it started the craze, 'nazi zombies' i highly recommend this game, as it showcases activisions true potential."
call of duty: world at war,it is fun
call of duty: world at war,probably is the best cod game ever. the campaign is just amazing and zombies is pretty fun too.
call of duty: world at war,"very good game, holds up surprisingly well compared to other games, the zombies will always be the best thing about the treyarch call of duty games. definitely worth the buy."
call of duty: world at war,best call of duty game i've ever played 10/10
call of duty: world at war,definently worth the money. you can spend thousands of hours going through all of the custom zombie maps. great game.
call of duty: world at war,"well, what can i say about this game? i can start off by saying that it is the most outstanding brilliant game modded! being a modded game may sound bad but it does come with its advantages! main advantage: modded zombies. people mainly buy this game mostly for the zombies purely because the multiplayer servers for cod: waw is pretty much dead, everyone plays the later instalments of cod but if you're a true zombie player like yoteslaya or yamimash, then you will love this game. this game has the standard campaign and when you finish that, you will unlock a game mode called zombies. zombies is a game mode where you will receive an endless amount of zombies going up in waves. e.g. wave 1: 8 zombies, wave 2: 14 zombies and so on. because this game is quite dated, it is easily modded and most of the modders live on a site called there are hundreds of zombies maps designed for cod: waw zombie players, modded to the extreme as they include; custom zombie maps designed by the community, not any standard zombies map guns are ported across from mw1/mw2/mw3/black ops 1/2 and maybe some aw guns in the future! player models can be changed for example, in some waw maps you can play as some of the characters from black ops 1: call of the dead the list just goes on! second advantage: it's not even that hard to download modded zombie maps, on the website they simply ask you to download an .exe file which will install the zombie maps in the directory c:\users\&lt;your computer name&gt; \appdata\local\activision\codwaw\mods. if you even wanted to design your own zombie map, it takes about a few days to learn how to do it and a good couple of weeks to finish of a piece of well-designed work. not much code involved. how do i play these maps? you have to click the 'mods' option which will bring up a list of your installed maps. url=store.steampowered.com ] [/url] google chrome says these modded maps from zombie modding are malicious? i am not quite sure why google chrome says these maps are malicious, probably because they are .exe files. don't worry, if you download them from zombie modding then they should be virus free, if not report them on the website. thank you for reading my review, if it's any good thumbs up so others can see."
call of duty: world at war,"multiplayer sucks now since theres alot of hackers on there, campaign is still pretty desent, zombies is very good with friends. *i recommend playing campaign first before zombies if ur new to the cod francise or new to pc cod*"
call of duty: world at war,downloaded a custom map called lsd it had a deez nuts joke and was verry trippy 10/10 would deez nuts trip again. - ignnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
call of duty: world at war,"i initially bought this game for the custom zombie maps, and i have absolutely fallen in love with this game. even the campaign in this game is awesome. even though this isn't one of the newest games, it is still amazing to play. 10/10"
call of duty: world at war,9/10 brillant campaign epic zombie maps/mods multiplayer is meh... game doesn't make it easy for you to use xbox/ps3 wired controllers if that wasn't there it would be 10/10
call of duty: world at war,the best cod there ever was......
call of duty: world at war,"for people wanting to buy this game, the multiplayer is fine there a a even amount of running servers so you will always be able to play muliplayer. as for the people who are buying to play zombies , there a a very small amount of servers (2-3) so if u want this game for solo zombies its fine , if you have friends to play zombies with its fine , but if your buying to play with random people you will have a hard time getting a game ."
call of duty: world at war,"easily one of if not my favorite cods, this game is the one that changed it all. the great story, great characters and gameplay it offers a great variety of missions to play. i have always been into cod zombies and because of the mod options of this one, you can make it almost an entirely different game. it really is hard to find something to complain about here, even though the graphics may not be order 1866 level it still holds up and the dark grays and blood help set the mood. i got this game when it was on sale. but i think it is fully worth its base price and is a game i still play to this day."
call of duty: world at war,this will always be the best and last good call of duty game
call of duty: world at war,best game to play zombies with :d
call of duty: world at war,"awesome game. great campaign, zombie maps and plenty of custom maps 9.9/10"
call of duty: world at war,"even if you hate call of duty, this game is more than any other cod. free maps, custom weapons, customs zombies/bosses. this game is so worth it. this game is by far one of the best cod's ever. this is one of the most fun, chaotic, and best game play for multi-player and zombies ever. this game is my childhood and the wwii genre is by far my favorite. can't ever say no to this game. i absolutely love it along with black ops 1 and cod 4. i doubt anyone who buys this will be disappointed."
call of duty: world at war,"the game, for the most part, is quite 'fair'. some of the guns are kinda better than others but not so much it breaks the game (like the recent cods) you can ride tanks, play with 48 other players, and have friends to play coop steam is yet to be intergrated into this, and it might never will, so think of an original name. hackers are nowhere to be seen unlike the console versions. finally the campaign is good enough to play, as you arent the super mach mason. instead you are a pvt, with multiple superioirs at your assistance. you arent alone."
call of duty: world at war,"very poor campaign both solo and co-op. multiplayer is ok i.e. it follows the standard call of duty formula. zombies on the other hand is excellent. the original nazi zombie mode from this game puts all other attempts from the cod series to shame. because of this, and only this, i would recommend this game."
call of duty: world at war,"great game, awesome story, multiplayer, and the first ever call of duty with zombies mode"
call of duty: world at war,its fun to play and thereare so many additions to it
call of duty: world at war,"one of the best cods imo, singleplayer: great story, and at the end u even unlocked a zombie modus! multiplayer: kinda sad to see that over 80% of the servers are empty, but there are like 30 servers upto 64 players and yes it can be caotic but funny as hell and makes alot fun! :) 3 killstreaks aviable: uav (see enemys on radar), let the dogs free (literally), and mortar! bombard everyone muahhahahaha also dozens of weapon, gas grenades, flamethrower!, didnt saw any hackers so far, yup its good i r8 8/8 m8"
call of duty: world at war,"probably the best call of duty game so far. the campaign is amazing, and the zombies mode is a blast with friends. even though the game is 6-7 years old, it is still my favorite call of duty."
call of duty: world at war,"call of duty: world at war pros and cons ============== pros --------------------- - friendly multiplayer community - fun zombies, especially custom maps - intriguing campaign - never gets old, even after 7 years - still very populated - inexpensive wwii simulator - no port forwarding required to host a private server for your friends - most perks i've seen in a [respectably decent] cod game --------------------- cons --------------------- - graphics aren't the best - zombies can get boring after round 15 on about every map - even though custom zombies maps are fun, they can be difficult to install - modders/hackers on undedicated servers - often cracked tdm servers with too much xp - almost all tdm servers are hardcore mode - little to no public zombies servers - easy to use cheats on any server (mostly private, though) ============== what would i rate this game? --------------------- i would give this game a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars. --------------------- other comments --------------------- pretty solid game for 2008. well done, treyarch."
call of duty: world at war,"great game all around, still has a great fan base and many players to play with, i rarely have problems with matchmaking or a variety of lobbies. guns are equal and stats are great."
call of duty: world at war,its amazing how treyarch thinks of zombies as a quote 'bonus gamemode' and its also amazing how treyarch obviously thinks of zombies as a bad idea (wow they were so right!) and how half the people never touched anything but zombies and how you havent bought the ♥♥♥♥♥ game yet its all so amazing.
call of duty: world at war,playing campain: -hard fight with the japs everyones almost dead- -turns the the sargent and he has the happest face and he looks at me and just says- everyone on me ~ ;3 10/10 would miller again
call of duty: world at war,"this is going to be my overview of call of duty: world at war, but i am only going to be looking at the zombies mode. nacht der untoten: a great map to start off zombies. that ray gun though. verrukt: nothing special, it introduced those sanic zombies. and the ppsh-41. and the perk-a-cola's. man this map had a lot of stuf- shi no numa:this map introduced my favorite wunder weapon in zombies, you guessed it the wunderwaffe dg-2, also hell hounds were also introduced. der reise: the best zombies map out of bo1 and waw. bo2 had origins... sorry der riese. plus pack-a-punch was intorduced. who can forget that? 10/10 would shock 10-25 zombies with a pack-a-punched waffle again."
call of duty: world at war,pros: great port zombies is fun if you have friends. custom maps make zombies even more fun zombies campaign is fun cons: the multiplayer sucks ♥♥♥♥. finding a zombie server is nearly impossible unless you have every map known to man and have a mlg server password cracker. need to restart the game evertime you want to tab in from multiplayer to single player. overall raiting:7/10 buy this when its on sale for 10$ not worth the full 19.99
call of duty: world at war,spoiler alert = the nazis lose
call of duty: world at war,"cod: world at war, is easily one of the best call of duty games ever made. first off, the game goes back to its ww2 roots, after the giant success which is modern warfare. the single player campaign is solid, it really helps that waw focuses on some of the less popular battles from world war ii, instead of giving you battles on d-day at normandy, which would have been like the millionth recreation within a ww2 game, the game covers an american campaign across multiple islands in the pacific, as well as the red army's comeback at the battle of stalingrad, which leads up to the fall of berlin. all of this provides lots of interesting new battlefields. you will still see some more familiar spots within bombed-out cities, and the farmlands of the eastern front missions, but it is all still incredibly well done. war, as you probably know, is an unforgiving and brutal affair, but the pacific and the eastern front were especially so. in the game, japanese soldiers will swarm you out of bushes, erupting straight out of spider holes and charge straight at you in an attempt to run you through with their bayonets. they'll play dead and wait for you to walk into the middle of a trap. although the game is primarily set outdoors, most of the game is played in close quarters combat. meanwhile, on the russian front, there are plenty of absoulutely merciless moments to be had. soldiers on both sides of the war on this front, russian, and german. soldiers of both sides gun down wounded or unarmed soldiers, and sometimes you're asked to pull the trigger yourself in situations like this. but, this remains a call of duty game, through and through. what i mean by this, is that the action is both fast, and fluid, and the game is rigidly scripted. enemy soldiers, as well as your computer-controlled teammates respawn endlessy until you advance far enough to hit the triggers to make them stop coming at you. then, you find yourself at the next firefight, and repeat the process all over again, but, you're usually far too busy ducking, and shooting your way around the level, and occasionaly dying, to really notice this much of the time. the sense of immersion is really outstanding. there are plenty of deafinging, large-scale battles, but there's also a bit of variation to change things up. a perfect example is the pby mission, where man the guns of a navy aircraft, while you are in the midst of a raging air and sea battle, taking fire, and fighting for your life, while trying to save the lives of sailors stranded in the water. all of this sounds great, but it hurts the game in one way. the narrative skips over months at a time, and showcases the major battles in the campaign. the result of this, is that the sense of story may not be as strong as you would expect it to be. in the end, the single-player campaign is relatively short, but it doesn't drag on too long to be unenjoyable either. and, as a bonus, there is a lot of replayability in the story, because the bulk of the campaign is playable in cooperative mode, with up to three other players. multiplayer (while it has a lot less players than console, or than when the game originally launched) is an area where waw shines really bright. modern warfare, quite arguably had on of the best multiplayer suites in history, and waw built upon it. there is a create-a-class system, and a ranking system, that lets you unlock perks, weapons, and other general upgrades, that you can use as the building blocks for tailor your own personal load-out, and play-style. kill-streaks are in the game, and are simmilar to modern warfare's, but with a twist more accurate to the time frame of the game. (uav=spotting plane, airstrike=artillery strike, attack helicopter=attack dogs) there is also plenty of game mades to choose from. then, there's my personal favorite aspect to the game. nazi. mother♥♥♥♥ing. zombies. nazi zombies is a game mode, where you and up to three others are put together against an endless onslaught of neverending waves of zombies. as you progress the waves get harder, either by adding more total zombies, making them faster, or both. you gain points for killing zombies, and rebuilding baricades, and these points can be used to buy weapons, ammo, and to open doors granting you access to other parts of the map. there's even a mystery box, which costs 950 points for every weapon, that gives you a random weapon. one of those van even be a ray gun, straight out of 1940's era pulp fiction. and, as an added bonus on pc, you get all 3 bonus maps included with the game, which cost 9.99 each on console, and the wonder of custom maps. you can download a free, and safe map launcher, from which you can download maps made buy the community, with the same rules as before, unless changed by the creator. overall, the game is packed with a ridiculously deep amount of gameplay, with appeal to almost every kind of player. all the way from those who want to experience a gritty solo campaign, those who want to play with their friends, and those just want to play the multiplayer. the game is an awesome addition to the franchise, with plenty to offer to the casual gamer, and the hardcore gamer alike.-----9.75/10"
call of duty: world at war,still holds its own against any and every zombies game made since its release. (tlou doesn't count cause its not on pc...) :p

call of duty: world at war,best call of duty out of all. 9/10. good campaign. very good zombies. good multiplayer
call of duty: world at war,"the best installment in the series. by far. 8/10. the game is alive, it's a sickly, injured, poor game. but it's alive. and what i mean by that is, i need people to play. nobody hosts, and nobody joins. the multiplayer is decent, and the zombies are amazing."
call of duty: world at war,"how did i even get this game, i have no recognition of buying it 20.4/10"
call of duty: world at war,if you like zombie games this is definatley the game to get.
call of duty: world at war,need to make it more server/user friendly but besides good game olus [retty cheap so thumbs up :)
call of duty: world at war,"this cod is one of a kind game, no quickscoping or smg campers. what's the best, no kids yelling at mic like 'yeay tripleeeeee!' 'yeaaaah moaab!' or some teenager boy telling you how you suck, because you didn't ran around quickscoping everyone else."
call of duty: world at war,this is a good game
call of duty: world at war,+all dlc free +multiplayer still active +custom zombie maps +mods -low fov for online zombies -common to come across aimbotters
call of duty: world at war,this is the best cod! but what happened to the big maps on the new cods? :/ :d
call of duty: world at war,i like this game because campaign is the best old but cold
call of duty: world at war,"if you are into world war ii games this is a must get. the singleplayer alone will captivate you for hours,but its the mutliplayer which is the epic part of the game. theres nothing better than playing at night with 16 v 16 on a dome tdm match with double barrel shotgun with artillery everywhere its the most fun you can have online. overall i give this game a 9.5/10"
call of duty: world at war,dont buy it for multiplayer ! it was too scary the custom zombie maps are great and you can have alot of fun with your friends ! overall if you love zombies you should buy this !
call of duty: world at war,"if you want to play zombies, this lets you play zombies seriously, the mods for this game are outstanding incredibly fun with friends"
call of duty: world at war,"my second favorite call of duty of all time. in my unpopular opinion, it achieved the greatness call of duty 4 was going for but didn't fully conquer. it's an authentic world war ii shooter with plenty of weapons of the era to choose from. the story (which can be played in co-op) and characters are for the most part very good despite being significantly short, and the gameplay is frantic and exciting. the multiplayer is amazing in pretty much every sense, with an unconventional design for call of duty 's standards. this was the one in the series that started zombies as well, and while nacht der untoten isn't a highlight of the game mode it is raw and hardcore, and der riese is outstanding especially with friends. filled with mysteries. the mode also gave birth to the marvelous soundtrack provided by kevin sherwood &amp; elena siegman. treyarch did a fine job with this one. 8.1/10.0"
call of duty: world at war,i like world war 2 the japan is very stupid i hate japan
call of duty: world at war,"a review of the blood and gore effects in call of duty: world at war tl;dw - good body damage with great looking dismemberment, good initial blood spilling effects (though there are no blood pools or blood trails for wounded characters), decent response and death animations. the absolute biggest issues are disappearing blood and wounds with no option to make them stay."
call of duty: world at war,"the best thing i love about this game is the full campaign coop! you can play coop with your friend for the story campaign from start to the end. the campaign story is quite interesting, and contains a lot of different aspect of war for you to experience: like being a captured hostage waiting to be executed, using a flamethrower to burn enemy fortress, shooting snipers out of the trees, and driving a friggin tank! the zombie mode provides a lot of extra fun if you have friends to play with. being an old game, there are a huge library of custom maps and mods for this game that are very stable and fun on the internet. beware though. despite being a very old release, i still cannot play it in high graphic settings. i need to lower my resolution to lower-than-average to get playable framerates. this game is really poorly optimized. it would be better if this game had steam achievements. my score: 8/10"
call of duty: world at war,"ok so here is my review about this game. firstly i want to say that i was playing that game quite a lot on my nintendo wii. i was totaly shocked (graphics suckthe same for controllers). i was watching a lot of custom zombie maps for that game and i was wandering to buy that game to play with my firends. today i did it, i bought the game i and i am happy. i want to make kinda of a small pros/cons table pros: -graphics are pretty good -gameplay is ok if you want to kill some japanese asses (dont be angry on me i am not a racist) -weapons, i can talk a lot about them -zombies are awesome -custom maps cons: -to hard to be leveled up in mp -over racism -zombies are quite hard for new players -not a lot of players now a days -some bugs -graphics are not amazing -same with gameplay in the end i want to say that if you want to buy that game make sure some one form your friend list owns that game so you will not play alone :d if what add me kamikazi300 thx activision for that game :d"
call of duty: world at war,"this ♥♥♥♥ing game......worth every ruble! i just recently bought this game on pc (a few months ago) but i have so much experience playing this game especially on xbox. now for pc i've never really tried playing the multiplayer all that much so this review is mainly based upon nazi zombies. like, holy ♥♥♥♥, i've played nazi zombies on xbox for years (on the later cod's as well). and i must say this one is by far the best on pc. why? custom nazi ♥♥♥♥ing zombies, that's why! you can go to certain websites that allow you to download zombie maps made by people, and there are maps still being created to this day! it never gets old! you can play them on solo but playing with people is just so much more fun! five years from now i will still be playing this game. maybe treyarch will revamp this game in the future ;) definitely worth $19.99 for the amount of custom maps you can get for yourself."
call of duty: world at war,best ww2 simulator ever. better explained ww2 than my teacher explained it.
call of duty: world at war,it is a awsome game
call of duty: world at war,the best call of duty ever made and will ever be!! campaign- the capaign is good not the best campaign in cod but its good 6/10 multiplayer- the multiplayer is very fun!! no hackers 9/10 zombies-very fun with custom maps too!-10/10
